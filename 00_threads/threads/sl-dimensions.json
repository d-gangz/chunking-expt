Or, are any of you aware of any late-stage private tech companies who have implemented this approach (i.e. not Apple, Meta, Amazon, which follow a similar approach)? Specifically, I'd love to know: * Are you seeing this trend in your networks, and if so, how is it working in practice? * What pitfalls have you encountered (beyond the obvious need for solid documentation and legal review of terminations)? * Any practical tips for managing risk or handling edge cases that aren't obvious from the outside? Would appreciate any real-world examples or lessons learned--especially from companies that don't have the litigation budgets of the public tech giants. Thanks."

I argued that there are still the equivalent state-level rules that impact us, but am wondering if folks are scaling back on compliance with any specific aspect of the rule. (We updated our signup process to require affirmative consent of our Terms and Privacy Policy, consent to automatic billing, and also providing the required disclosures -- our cancellation process was compliant so we have no concerns there).",

Our global employment counsel has advised either globalizing the bonus plan (similar to what we have done for our commission plan), add country-specific riders, or fully and expressly incorporate the bonus terms into the contracts rather than referencing the standalone program document.

        "Hello everyone - curious if any legal departments have surveyed their outside counsel firms to get a read on exactly how they are using AI, what tools for which tasks, and documenting any client benefits (especially specific to your work)? Stats like this from a recent Axiom survey make me wonder. \"With 79% of law firms using AI but only 6% passing savings to clients, in-house departments face a cruel irony: they must invest in AI capabilities while their outside counsel benefits from AI efficiencies without sharing cost savings.\"",
        "Hi everyone, I'm looking to better understand how other legal departments manage budgeting for outside counsel spend, particularly for ongoing or unanticipated matters. Our finance team requires us to forecast spend for all OC vendors, and any unused budget at the end of a quarter is forfeited (i.e., it does not roll over). As a result, whenever we need to engage a new vendor or initiate a new matter mid-quarter, we're typically asked to reallocate funds from existing line items within our annual budget. Historically, this hasn't been a significant issue for us, but as our OC spend grows, it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage on an ad-hoc basis and as you know, it is impossible to anticipate all possible OC related spend ahead of time. I'm curious how others navigate this challenge. How do you plan for unpredictable legal spend? Do you build in contingency buffers, establish separate discretionary pools, or engage finance differently to accommodate real-time needs?"
