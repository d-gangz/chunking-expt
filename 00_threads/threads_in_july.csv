I've recently joined my current company and have been looking into this issue as part of a broader payroll system transition. I've proposed the standard compliant route: reclassifying certain roles from exempt to non-exempt, tracking actual time worked via timesheets, and clearly ""providing"" (but not policing) meal and rest breaks in line with CA law. The plan would include having employees sign updated break policies and certify weekly on timesheets that they were offered all required breaks. Potentially it would also include a mechanism for pre-approval of overtime. That said -- I've been asked (unsurprisingly) whether other tech companies have found more ""elegant"" solutions. The concern isn't just about the admin of tracking hours -- it's also the cost of paying overtime. I'm fully aware of the legal requirements, but I need to understand what others are doing in practice -- especially in go-to-market orgs where the business feels that hourly classification undermines culture or incentives. If you've taken a different approach (or fought for the standard one and won), I'd really value hearing how you handled the legal, operational, and cultural angles. Feel free to DM if easier. Thanks!

In my opinion, a commercial lender will never agree to anything other than being the senior lien holder, but they would agree to a Subordination, Nondisturbance, and Attornment Agreement (SNDA) that would effectively provide them with the protection that they need.

On assessment our intended use cases will be ""low-risk"" (or rather, not ""high-risk""). We will be a ""deployer"" rather than a ""provider"" of AI systems. I had originally thought/assumed there would be some basic transparency obligations under the Act. However, in reading Article 50, it seems that perhaps even this is not required. Article 50 seems to specify transparency obligations for deployers:   1. of  ""an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system"", and/or   2. where the AI system ""generates or manipulates image, audio or video content constituting a deep fake"", and/or   3. where the AI system ""generates or manipulates text which is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest shall disclose that the text has been artificially generated or manipulated"".

Any transfer is subject to our approval, and we've historically been resistant to transfers outside of affiliate transfers or estate planning. Putting aside the IR aspect of managing the relationship with the selling LP, what other considerations have folks considered?  Immediate ones for me are the opportunity to foster the relationship with the secondary buyer and potentially commit to future funds; the taint of being uncooperative; potentially exchanging our approval for the buyer's pre-approval of a future LPAC or LP action (e.g., fund term extension); and optimizing our LP roster for known and trusted relationships.

The question we're trying to bottom out is - would a UK administrator/insolvency practitioner successfully be able to set aside/invalidate this part of the security package on the basis that the UK entity has actually not received the benefit of the loan and that therefore there was no benefit/consideration for the security being provided?

There was a thread last year that mentioned TermScout certification, and a few people shared positive experiences, but the focus of that discussion wasn't on ROI. I'd like to dig a bit deeper into whether the certification has meaningful value.  I'm particularly interested in whether certification has helped reduce negotiation timelines, served as a differentiator with customers or procurement teams, or prompted any feedback from customers. Even if you haven't used it, I'd be interested in your perspective on how much weight, if any, you give to the certification when reviewing a vendor's standard terms. For context, we're a SaaS company (employee relations case management), and our customers run the gamut from Fortune 100s to local governments. We see a wide range in the level of legal involvement -- some customers have experienced counsel reviewing our terms, while others rely entirely on procurement with little or no legal input.

Due to medical confidentiality, they didn't provide details but requested additional information in order to properly assess and quote."" They now want medical questionnaires filled out be employees. I have seen those questionnaires for self-funded plans before but have never seen them for fully funded plan quotes. Also I am concerned how the health insurance providers would have gotten access to any ""medications, pharmacies"" type information. Wouldn't that violate HIPAA without an employee consent for them to get RX info? This is not our current plan provider. I am wondering if the broker is giving us some wrong info. Anyone ever run into this? These are reputable plans - United and Aetna. I reviewed their privacy policies and pretty sure accessing RX info would violate them without signed consent. "

Our finance team requires us to forecast spend for all OC vendors, and any unused budget at the end of a quarter is forfeited (i.e., it does not roll over). As a result, whenever we need to engage a new vendor or initiate a new matter mid-quarter, we're typically asked to reallocate funds from existing line items within our annual budget. Historically, this hasn't been a significant issue for us, but as our OC spend grows, it's becoming increasingly difficult to manage on an ad-hoc basis and as you know, it is impossible to anticipate all possible OC related spend ahead of time. I'm curious how others navigate this challenge. How do you plan for unpredictable legal spend? Do you build in contingency buffers, establish separate discretionary pools, or engage finance differently to accommodate real-time needs? "

See here.  In today's remote environment, many roles are hired remotely and attorneys perform their work exclusively from their home state, where they are licensed. Income tax is generally withheld in the state in which the attorney is employed. However, they are providing legal services to their New York-based employers.

Our stock options are issued by our US Delaware topco but most of our employees are in the UK and we've set up a UK EMI sub-plan which we're about to start issuing from. The exercise price of the UK EMI is nominal value (i.e. $0.0001) as is pretty normal and is therefore quite a lot more preferential for employees than our 409A valuation.       Our counsel have told us that any US citizens or US tax residents would be barred from receiving options under the EMI scheme at the EMI nominal exercise price and that we would have to issue to them at the 409A (we're talking about a few individuals who've been based in the UK for a while and one who is moving to the UK for long term). This seems a crazy outcome to not allow them to benefit from the EMI price - so am looking to see if anyone can corroborate this / has experience with practical alternatives that don't penalise the employees. If the answer is we have to issue at the 409A then OK but I am trying to achieve a better outcome for these individuals if possible! "

There was a lot of debate on the topic, so I wanted to share this benchmarking report on The State of AI in Business Communications. Enjoy!  Meeting & Communication AI Trends:   AI meeting assistants are going mainstream: Top features in demand include:   CRM integration (49%)   Real-time transcription (47%)   Automated call summaries (44%)   Voice-to-text & sentiment analysis (36-40%)   Voice analysis is hot: 81% plan to invest in AI for analyzing voice data within 12 months. Half already have clear strategies in place.   Executives are driving adoption: C-level execs are the most active users and champions of AI meeting tech (91% are leading voice AI adoption).   High ROI use cases: Voice data tools are linked to faster resolutions, fewer complaints, increased upsell opportunities, and lower agent burnout.   But… Security is a concern:   72% expect AI-generated fraud (e.g. deepfake voices) in the next year.   Yet, 31% of companies still haven't implemented fraud prevention tools.   Smaller orgs especially lack resources/confidence in detecting fraud.      The Bigger Picture:   97% of businesses expect to increase AI investment in the next 3-5 years.   Customer service and internal collaboration are the most common early applications.   AI is moving from automation -> augmentation--helping teams think, not just do. "

We are going through a majority recap with a large private equity firm. A number of employees have been at the company for a number of years, and thus have significant stock and option holdings that will be cashed out.   I, along with other members of the leadership team, do not want to be providing advice or answering individuals' questions, and instead we were thinking of finding a financial advisor who could speak to and generally educate the employee base on key issues they should be thinking about. The intent is that the advisor would not be giving individualized advice but would be in an educator role. Our outside counsel and audit firm are both not interested in taking on this type of role.  Has anyone done this in the context of a change of control transaction and/or are there any recommendations of individuals or firms that would be able to assist us? "
