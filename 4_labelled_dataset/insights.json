In-house leaders described the GC as the connective tissue for the business, while board advisors emphasized the need to shape board composition, agendas, and independent voices for real strategic debate. The common thread is that the GC earns influence not by reciting doctrine, but by curating information, structuring decisions, and aligning the board and executives around business outcomes. This dual posture—executive leader internally and board process architect externally—defines durable GC impact.",

I mean, it, it sounds like it means, uh, head lawyer, but, uh, I find that very little of what I do is actually legal advice. Um, so it's, it's much more than that.

From training schedules and 10b5‑1 plan reviews to pre‑clearance workflows and ESPP prospectuses, stock admins and brokers keep employees safe and the company compliant. On the deal side, that same rigor powers the disclosure schedules and data rooms buyers rely on. Investing early in the “ops layer” of equity pays dividends in execution speed and audit readiness.",

I really recommend having your stock administrator hired pre-ipo hire someone with a ton of experience if possible. They will save you they will help with this education and the communication... They also at least one who's in the room share works and I think Carter has it as well. All of that is is a great spot to be the repository for that information...

The job is uniquely lonely, balancing confidentiality with leadership; partnering with a seasoned board chair and using TechGC‑style networks provides sounding boards and pattern recognition.
