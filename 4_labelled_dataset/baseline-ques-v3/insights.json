Success hinges less on narrow legal expertise and more on executive presence, decision‑making under uncertainty, and the ability to lead beyond one’s lane. Effective GCs proactively build relationships with peers, translate legal risk into business terms, and step into operational gaps to advance outcomes.

I mean, it, it sounds like it means, uh, head lawyer, but, uh, I find that very little of what I do is actually legal advice. Um, so it's, it's much more than that. It's, you know, being a, a cross-functional kind of connective tissue between different parts of the organization, um, jumping in to lead things, um, because you want the company to be a success and not be necessarily because, um, it is in your legal lane.

The best GC managers set direction, give space, and hire people who outshine them in specific domains. Generosity with assignments, exposure, and time builds an empowered legal bench.

I dole out, you know, letting somebody take something even if I think maybe I could have done it faster, generous with my time when they have questions, when people need things. Uh, and, and generally generous with their exposure as well in that I want them to be viewed important in their own right. So that's just, that drives everything I do as far as managing a team is keeping that pillar in mind for myself.",
