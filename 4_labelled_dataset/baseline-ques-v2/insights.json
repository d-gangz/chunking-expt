Leaders must balance their own risk tolerance and ethical standards with those of their organizations, and when misalignment occurs, it may be necessary to reconsider their position or advocate for change. This is evident in both the context of legal practice in emerging tech and in board governance during company transitions.",

You know, we've all felt very uncomfortable with, uh, it could be something the business is doing, it could be something we've been asked to do. There's definitely a line of that discomfort. Like, it's okay to be a little uncomfortable, especially when you're learning, right? But it's not okay to be uncomfortable to the point where, you know, like your moral and ethical compass is spinning in the wrong direction. You know, look, there is definitely a spectrum of that. Like, people are gonna have a different, you know, kind of moral standard, or we shouldn't even call it morality. We should say appetite for risk. Sometimes the JC isn't a fit because they have an appetite for risk that doesn't align with the company. But make sure that if your appetite for risk doesn't align with the company, then you either find an alternative job or you get comfortable with the risk that they're taking.",

Things like that. Sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn't. Um, I've had, uh, a lot of luck cultivating that trust in the organization that I'm at now. Um, that was something that was really important to me in a prior role. I led with that. Um, and I noticed that the, the communication and messaging that, that they were portraying outward so to potential clients, to, um, potential employees, uh, that were going through the interview process, didn't necessarily match up what was happening within the organization. Um, and for me, it wasn't, uh, that they were breaking any laws or, um, or even lying. It just seemed as though actions didn't match words.

If we feel like if it's a hotspot, we will have those moderated or facilitated, um, not by senior management, but by people in the company who are trusted. And we talk to them about how to facilitate it. Um, but we also, what we have come up with is a charter of mindful communication, which really is a way of reframing sometimes questions get asked that are not asked in a really nice way, but if you peel it back, there's a really legitimate question there. And so by putting up, whenever we have our q and a, the charter of mindful communication, which is like read the room, um, ask, ask questions that you really want answered, assume best intentions, it's, it's, you know, a few basics. Um, by doing that, um, people tend to reframe questions that could start off as hostile into construction, constructive questions, um, and other people in the room will call them out on it and say, reframe that.

But if put in front of a neutral arbiter like a judge, could I advocate for this position with a straight face? Could I convince potential strategic partners that I had done a degree of diligence on the regulatory risk? If those answers need to be, yes, those answers absolutely need to be yes. If they're not, then you're in a problematic space, you know, basically from a practical viewpoint, but also potentially from an ethical viewpoint. Hmm. So there's a lot of gray area.

So I joined Jasper three years ago, um, before chat GBT became publicly available, uh, which partially obliterated our downmarket business at Jasper, but that's okay. Um, we pivoted, but before then, and probably for the six months thereafter, chat, GBT and the generally available tools were pretty horrendous at doing legal work. Like I think whenever they test him on the bar, they were hardly passing or like not passing. Since then, like over the last 18 months to 24 months, the general tools have become super useful and then there's all these legal AI startups that have spr it up with specific tools. And beginning about two years ago we started like heavily implementing, um, tool usage for AI within our legal department. And over that two year period, our outside counsel spend has decreased 93%. So we we're saving like $200,000 a year. And that our outside council firms probably aren't real, but like we go to AI as like a what you would treat like a junior or even mid-level associate. Some of these firms, which it blows my mind nowadays when you get bills for junior associates that are seven 50 bucks an hour. Um, so like we, we use that largely for like high stake stuff, obviously, like if it's a financing or an acquisition, we're still gonna use like real outside firms. But for the day-to-day stuff that most of us like at L Suite in-house departments, um, we just need to like expand our reach and speed as quickly and as cheaply as possible. And AI has in my mind, revolutionized the practice of law by being able to do that. So yeah, we've saved 92% over two years. And then in terms of like time saved, I'm sure I could like get, get an accurate or close to accurate hours per week saved. But I think the better metric is that given our like legal intake volume, our sales contract review volume and all that, we should be ending this year with five or six attorneys. We should currently have four, we only have two and we're not like crazy overworked or not more than anyone else and we don't plan on adding head count by the end of the year. So if you take that for what it's worth, it's like essentially one lawyer is doing the work of three by using AI Now",

          "quoted_text": "I think so going back to Ethan Malik's book co Intelligence, one of the things he says is, um, to begin using AI constantly and you'll, you'll start noticing where it's strong, where it's weak, and that itself will build your confidence. I'm definitely a power user of ai. There's nothing I do now at work that doesn't incorporate ai, um, like literally every single question I'm receiving and responding to, unless it's live on a call like this where I can't. And even even then we use transcribing notes, um, notes through these tools that, you know, we'll do speech to text nowadays, which are pretty good. Um, but the more you use it, I think the more comfortable you'll get. And even if it seems like something that, ah, I don't need to use this, I know this, um, like the back of my hand, it's useful for you to build up the confidence to use the tool so that then when a problem comes along that it's like really well suited for, you can use that. And then just also keep it in mind that these tools, you should treat them as like a junior associate at a law firm or like an entry level or they're pretty good and that they'll give you a lot of good content, but at the end of the day, you're still the actual human and the attorney and you should be checking it. You shouldn't just be outsourcing this to ai. I think those are really good points. And then also I think that generally when I can, I try to use these tools in a narrow scope using really easily falsifiable questions and answers. So I'll, even though citations can be wrong, I make it site, I make it reason and that makes it easier for me to sort of spot check outputs and that that gives me greater confidence. Although of course when something is partially thinking for you, you can, you can never be totally a hundred percent, but it helps.",

Um, getting, getting a public company ready board needs to happen, you know, at least sometimes like 18 months, two years before you're gonna go out. Um, in particular, just because these days it's not just finding an audit committee financial expert and finding folks who can read financial statements. Um, if any of you have companies that are headquartered in California, you have to comply with the, you know, the California laws, uh, with respect to having, you know, women being on your board and underrepresented minorities on your board. Um, and for anyone who is planning to list on nasdaq, NASDAQ just came out with their rules, right? So your board, uh, within a year of listing would have to have a, a woman and an underrepresented minority, uh, on the board. And so also with the increased focus from like ISS, glass Lewis and every single major fund from Fidelity to State Street, to, you know, BlackRock, they all have governance guidelines now and, uh, diversity, uh, and, and, and focus on, you know, having effective boards is really, really important. So I think to Alan's point, like coming up with a strategy far earlier than actually being public about what is my board, you know, here to do and actually putting together like a rubric for what I want out of it, and, you know, coming up with actual competency matrices and who's checking kind of, uh, you know, what boxes, and it's not just from a, you know, this is a, a diverse candidate, but you know, someone who has operational background, someone who has experience scaling my particular type of business, um, you know, someone who has experience on doing, you know, extensive m and a, if that's a big part of your, your strategy, um, making sure that you're kind of filling those gaps and to Alan's point, planning how you're gonna fill those and starting a conversation early with, uh, you know, with your existing board members about how we're gonna reach those goals and transition to it. So it's a smooth glide into becoming a public company as opposed to this being like a slap dash rush, right? Like at an org meeting where you're frantically competing for candidates because, um, as I'm sure many of you are aware right now that the market for finding, um, independent board members, let alone people who can, uh, you know, folks who are women, folks who are underrepresented minorities, it is, it's very, very competitive right now. Um, and if you have to also be filling audit, you know, just audit competency, it's just, it's, it's a very competitive market. So starting the dialogue a lot earlier than you'd think can be actually a mechanism for you to help maneuver, uh, maneuver your board in the direction of going more independent, um, uh, you know, for the, for the long term.",

So I'll give you my one challenge that I'm thinking about. You know, we've got a, um, ex a an engaged board of directors, but we don't have, uh, a lot of public company director experience on our board.

So we had a third training on the Employee Stock purchase plan and we made recordings of those trainings available. But we we didn't have the slide decks available separately because you do need the voice over particularly with respect to the espp because that's that's a prospectus. It can be treated as an offering of stock. So you need to make sure it's up to date and make sure you have all of the information being delivered at the same time. So be careful in general with what you distribute in hard copy and you can do presentations by Zoom. They don't need to be in person but be prepared for a lot of questioning. It does depend on your employee base how large a company of course whether you're Global but also the company culture really makes a difference. Recursion we had a very transparent culture free IPO and we also have an endlessly curious and questioning and you know, very intelligent employee base. And so they would just pepper us with questions. And at one point I considered preparing an FAQ document because some of the questions would occur and you know, you're saying the same things over and over but there's a real downside to having You know any kind of information in writing other than the actual insider trading policy and the scrubbed deck that is the equity overview. So ultimately we didn't have FAQs that we prepared. But we also had asked me anything sessions in addition to the three categories of training that I mentioned and there are people could have more one-on-one attention and obviously as I said before you can't be giving people investment or tax advice, but Some folks need that personal attention. The stock administrator is absolutely critical in this regard. I really recommend having your stock administrator hired pre-ipo hire someone with a ton of experience if possible. They will save you they will help with this education and the communication and they're able to hold people's hands in a way that you will not have the time to do and also the distribution of information. It's a great spot. If you decide you're going to put out pieces and when we work with companies, we actually do because we feel like you got to educate them. Yeah, providing Financial or tax advice, but you can you can simplify. A lot of complicated things for them and then you can refer them off to wherever you firm, but the stock administrators portals or the employees go and they're looking at all their information. They also at least one who's in the room share works and I think Carter has it as well. All of that is is a great spot to be the repository for that information. So you make sure everyone's getting the same information. It's been blessed by legal. It's been blessed by around in tax. Yeah.

And because of that we have like an internal mandate to, for everybody across the organization, if you're an engineer or lawyer finance, to use AI as much as you can basically to increase efficiency, lower costs. Um, so in terms of from executive buy-in, it was, it was mandated so it was easy to get buy-in there. Um, we don't, you might find it ironic, but we don't like have a formal AI use policy. I've seen those floating around. Um, in fact, I find it funny that like, uh, uh, default form one on Westlaw itself, practical law includes Jasper. It's one of the recommended tools. I did not have any, um, input into having that shoved in there. But you know, I think it's good if you're, especially if you're a big organization or one that regularly handles sensitive data like, like FinTech industry or finance industry or biotech to implement some type of internal company policy.

So use Acme Co instead of Jasper. Uh, the tools like White Shoe and GC AI do this naturally.

And you enter all this information and then the M'S responses throughout the platform automatically incorporate that information and it's encrypted and like remains secure too, which is useful and speeds up processes and makes it more accurate, all that stuff.

Once, one, I'd give the same scared straight compliance presentation, or I should say I did at Maple, where, look, we, we've all given presentations of best practices. Um, sometimes your compliance team might do that. Sometimes it means more when legal is involved. But I actually feel this presentation chock full with real life ripped from the headlines. Examples of individual liability. Like, I think you need to speak about this in, in, you know, ways that your sales guy can understand. And if you're talking about regulatory issues or implications in a way that only lawyers will understand, it's really not gonna resonate. Where if you, you know, give them concrete examples of traders who have actually served prison time because of something stupid that they put in a chat like that is a lot more impactful. So, you know, speak to like the scared straight portion of, you know, advocating for high ethical standards. Make sure you're speaking to them in a language that they can understand that that's really gonna resonate with all levels of the organization. Second tone from the top, and this is twofold. One, ensure that your organization's CEO makes this a non-negotiable. If it isn't, well that's just kind of a problem generally, and there's, it's really hard to change that, I'll just say. So maybe that's something you think about long term as you contemplate a longer term move. But two, even if your CEO is a good person, make sure he is vocally supporting legal and compliance and vocally ensuring like, we have zero tolerance for X, Y, Z, um, and make sure he or she communicates that loudly and frequently. Mm-Hmm. And then secondarily, you and your legal team and your compliance team should really be living and breathing, breathing best practices of ethical conduct. Like, I, I think we've all been there maybe in different contexts where it's someone at the holiday party, like it's the lawyer in the room who gets too drunk and starts making inappropriate comments. It, it's bad. It's a bad look. It's a terrible look actually, because I kind of think of myself as gc. Like, it's always difficult to navigate, like, I'm not here to be your mom. Uh, but I am also, and, and I wanna be your friend, and I want you to be able to come to me and confide in me and communicate with me and know that you're in a safe place, but also know that I'm not gonna b******t you. This is not okay. And my best interests are gonna lie with the company. And I expect, you know, I am a, I'm a culture carrier for top ethical standards at my organization.

Um, and it's pretty short and easy to get your hands on. I think it's less than 200 pages. But one of the things he talks about in terms of crafting good prompts to have the best re responses from AI is to give it first a role to play. So in the legal context, um, having it, telling it to act as an attorney and not just any attorney, but trying to narrow down on the specific expertise you're wanting it to have.

And you've, you've not only gotta ask the the person to step down, um, but you've gotta ask the VC to, to give up their right. There is a middle ground there that I see sort of work, which is to allow them to keep their contractual right and appoint, you know, an independent to their seat that you agree on. I don't love that solution. 'cause I think it, it compromises that incoming director's ability to truly feel independent if they are, you know, at the, at the behest of contractually, at the behest of a, of a particular investor. Um, even if that investor is saying, I'm not gonna exercise that, right? But that can be a bridge too, right? That can be a way to allow the VC to save face with their peers and not having to give up their rights while getting the person that you want in the door. And, you know, maybe nine months down the road that changes. Um, I do think that there's a, you know, a hard conversation that has to be had there. And usually it's the CEO that's, that's having it. Um, it's another situation where I think having an ally on the board, you know, um, can, can be valuable because it, it's personal and, and at one level you're telling, um, that director that you want off for whatever reason, that you don't find their contributions as valuable as the others. And that may be who their fund is and what connections they have. That may be their actual level of participation and engagement. Um, you know, I guess it's easier if they are openly disengaged or not attending or those sorts of things, but it's often more subtle than that. And so, you know, the, the worst situations I've seen that discussion led to a, you know, a conflict between the CEO and the director asked to leave that spilled out into, you know, the boardroom and was a public conflict and, and people were left feeling, uh, feeling badly about it. At the end of the day. I, I think the best situations I've seen, actually, it's a public company context, but I'm not sure it doesn't translate, were situations where there was a chair who himself ultimately needed to step aside in favor of new blood and, uh, open the dialogue, you know, a quarter in advance with the board about what the objectives are and how, you know, we've got a board that is here and we want to get it to here for these reasons. Whether it's diversity, bringing in more independence, um, bringing in more audit committee expertise, bringing in more operational skill sets to mentor the CEO. Um, we need to achieve all those objectives. And, you know, that's gonna involve some transitioning of board members. I, I'd like to hear from each of you what your, you know, continued interest level is in participating, but I'm gonna be talking to you about that dialogue and how we, how we order it. And I, I think trying to get people focused on why you're doing this in a way that is not personal to them and what, why it's good for the company is good table setting and just framing it and then building a plan where the succession that needs to happen is staged over time. So, you know, maybe one seed is surrendered every year, and that's known in advance. You know, we're gonna move out our series A director next year, and we're gonna replace them with, um, an independent diverse board member. And then in the second year, as we're a year away from IPO, we're gonna move out our series B board member and we're gonna replace 'em with an audit committee chair. Um, I think also having a plan, um, you know, can, can let the other directors participate in the plan, and it doesn't feel like that first person that got tapped is the one that's getting picked on.",

But I think in order to ensure and set yourself up for success or to, um, you know, one is, uh, to I think Jolie's point, like putting together like an executive summary that's like pretty, you know, tight that's gonna hit on all of the major points is gonna be important. So if someone is short on time, they at least have a single source that is gonna have all of the material points that need to be conveyed to the board and potentially teed up for discussion in, in an executive summary.

And then there's a completely separate much, much, much shorter deck that will just guide the discussion.

So meaning making sure that your board members actually know how to access and use the platform, um, or if you're, you know, using Google Docs or whatever it is, just making sure that folks technologically can get a hold of the docs. That's, I think a kind of a bit of a complaint that I've seen from, from board members that they, you know, quote, I didn't know how to download it or I didn't know how to get the materials. It's a, it's a low bar thing, but um, just something that you should, you should be checking on. Um, and again, like also just making sure that you get the materials out with sufficient advanced notice. Um, you know, I definitely think for our, our smaller private companies, you know, board materials are often going out only like less than 24 hours in advance. Sometimes it's quite a bit of a scramble, but I think the expectation in particular as you, as you grow as a company is those materials need to be going out with, you know, needs to be more time.

Um, getting, getting a public company ready board needs to happen, you know, at least sometimes like 18 months, two years before you're gonna go out. Um, in particular, just because these days it's not just finding an audit committee financial expert and finding folks who can read financial statements. Um, if any of you have companies that are headquartered in California, you have to comply with the, you know, the California laws, uh, with respect to having, you know, women being on your board and underrepresented minorities on your board. Um, and for anyone who is planning to list on nasdaq, NASDAQ just came out with their rules, right? So your board, uh, within a year of listing would have to have a, a woman and an underrepresented minority, uh, on the board. And so also with the increased focus from like ISS, glass Lewis and every single major fund from Fidelity to State Street, to, you know, BlackRock, they all have governance guidelines now and, uh, diversity, uh, and, and, and focus on, you know, having effective boards is really, really important. So I think to Alan's point, like coming up with a strategy far earlier than actually being public about what is my board, you know, here to do and actually putting together like a rubric for what I want out of it, and, you know, coming up with actual competency matrices and who's checking kind of, uh, you know, what boxes, and it's not just from a, you know, this is a, a diverse candidate, but you know, someone who has operational background, someone who has experience scaling my particular type of business, um, you know, someone who has experience on doing, you know, extensive m and a, if that's a big part of your, your strategy, um, making sure that you're kind of filling those gaps and to Alan's point, planning how you're gonna fill those and starting a conversation early with, uh, you know, with your existing board members about how we're gonna reach those goals and transition to it. So it's a smooth glide into becoming a public company as opposed to this being like a slap dash rush, right? Like at an org meeting where you're frantically competing for candidates because, um, as I'm sure many of you are aware right now that the market for finding, um, independent board members, let alone people who can, uh, you know, folks who are women, folks who are underrepresented minorities, it is, it's very, very competitive right now. Um, and if you have to also be filling audit, you know, just audit competency, it's just, it's, it's a very competitive market.

You shouldn't just be outsourcing this to ai. I think those are really good points. And then also I think that generally when I can, I try to use these tools in a narrow scope using really easily falsifiable questions and answers. So I'll, even though citations can be wrong, I make it site, I make it reason and that makes it easier for me to sort of spot check outputs and that that gives me greater confidence.

Like they have so much money, it's fine. It's fine. And it's like, wait, let's take a closer look here. So sometimes I, I, I, you know, you don't wanna be kind of, that's not in my job description in the, the due diligence of counterparties, but to some degree, it is always your job description as GC to be asking the difficult questions.

Having a diverse workforce, having diverse vendors, um, supporting our diverse community was really who we are.

Don't look at it as, as piecemeal, um, but really keep, uh, on track of it from, from the initial part of trying to bring people into the company through the whole time that they're there. All of this was not done in a year or a week or an hour. All of this has been done over several years, and it can be scaled to different sizes, but by measuring and reporting and getting people on board, you can really move the needle.",

I'm like, yeah, but it's not public yet. And I, I tend to fall back to Meredith's point about let's have the directors have one stop shopping for all of our content in one place. I have a four month old daughter and she's on my lap, so I apologize. Uh, but in addition to that, I would say that, you know, I think it can be challenging. It, it does go to quality control. You can leverage that argument sometimes. Data security is a big one I use to try and push for it. And I, and I do think the one-stop shopping makes it easier for directors. So they're not saying, wait, where is this thing? And the things that we end up at the outside the portal tend to be things like succession planning where it's super sensitive and they don't want everyone to have access to it.

Like Amazon starts every single meeting with like the first whatever, 10 or 15 minutes or for people to like literally sit quietly and read. Um, I, I kind of side a little bit with Alan in the sense of like, you know, you don't often have, you know, boards aren't meeting that frequently. Uh, it's usually four to six meetings a year. Um, and the expectation is that they would, um, that they would hopefully be doing a pre-read. But I think in order to ensure and set yourself up for success or to, um, you know, one is, uh, to I think Jolie's point, like putting together like an executive summary that's like pretty, you know, tight that's gonna hit on all of the major points is gonna be important. So if someone is short on time, they at least have a single source that is gonna have all of the material points that need to be conveyed to the board and potentially teed up for discussion in, in an executive summary. Um, followed up by, you know, like the more robust kind of PowerPoint that's gonna have all of the, you know, let's dive into the details. And then there's a completely separate much, much, much shorter deck that will just guide the discussion. Uh, and the, the talking points for the actual meeting itself, those shouldn't be the same deck. They need to be separate decks, which is the deep dive and then the actual presentation deck. Um, and then there's also just some nuts and bolts things too. Like I know a lot of folks are moving to actual board, um, platforms. So meaning making sure that your board members actually know how to access and use the platform, um, or if you're, you know, using Google Docs or whatever it is, just making sure that folks technologically can get a hold of the docs. That's, I think a kind of a bit of a complaint that I've seen from, from board members that they, you know, quote, I didn't know how to download it or I didn't know how to get the materials. It's a, it's a low bar thing, but um, just something that you should, you should be checking on. Um, and again, like also just making sure that you get the materials out with sufficient advanced notice. Um, you know, I definitely think for our, our smaller private companies, you know, board materials are often going out only like less than 24 hours in advance. Sometimes it's quite a bit of a scramble, but I think the expectation in particular as you, as you grow as a company is those materials need to be going out with, you know, needs to be more time. Um, so the board actually has time to, you know, review and digest it, not just 24 hours or 36 hours notice, um, for the materials.",

We have an AI machine learning platform that we use with image-based processing to develop essentially maps of human biology, and we now have four compounds in the clinic.

And we wanted Luisa here to make all the general counsels. Who are Facing all the pressure be really jealous of someone who got through her process of three months. I don't think I don't think you should be jealous. It was very very hard. You know, we we took about four months to do all of the preparation drafting ES1. I mean you name it. It was incredibly fast everything we do at recursion. We do fast to a very high standard as well, but I don't recommend it. So don't be don't be jealous. Actually.

They don't need to be in person but be prepared for a lot of questioning. It does depend on your employee base how large a company of course whether you're Global but also the company culture really makes a difference. Recursion we had a very transparent culture free IPO and we also have an endlessly curious and questioning and you know, very intelligent employee base. And so they would just pepper us with questions. And at one point I considered preparing an FAQ document because some of the questions would occur and you know, you're saying the same things over and over but there's a real downside to having You know any kind of information in writing other than the actual insider trading policy and the scrubbed deck that is the equity overview. So ultimately we didn't have FAQs that we prepared. But we also had asked me anything sessions in addition to the three categories of training that I mentioned and there are people could have more one-on-one attention and obviously as I said before you can't be giving people investment or tax advice, but Some folks need that personal attention. The stock administrator is absolutely critical in this regard. I really recommend having your stock administrator hired pre-ipo hire someone with a ton of experience if possible. They will save you they will help with this education and the communication and they're able to hold people's hands in a way that you will not have the time to do and also the distribution of information. It's a great spot. If you decide you're going to put out pieces and when we work with companies, we actually do because we feel like you got to educate them. Yeah, providing Financial or tax advice, but you can you can simplify. A lot of complicated things for them and then you can refer them off to wherever you firm, but the stock administrators portals or the employees go and they're looking at all their information. They also at least one who's in the room share works and I think Carter has it as well. All of that is is a great spot to be the repository for that information. So you make sure everyone's getting the same information. It's been blessed by legal. It's been blessed by around in tax. Yeah.

Um, but more likely just make us be able to be more efficient, quicker and with cheaper services, especially in-house that since we're not billing that helps. Um, with that being said, like G PT five has been on the back burner for a while now and the rumors are that like, when that comes out, it could like wipe the slight clean of a ton of these startups that have started over the last 12 to 18 months because it could be so good at knowing user intent that like, you don't remotely have to be good at prompting. You don't need any of these hacks or tweaks or models. It might just be so good at doing that right off the bat that it knows this is a lawyer asking me a question, I should act as a lawyer. I need to, you know, keep all this con information confidential. That stuff, who knows what that actually looks like, but rumors are that that's the case. So yeah, a year from now it could totally revolutionize it, but I think like a quick, an even if that doesn't happen, a quick anecdote using like existing technology, it's like we two months ago faced, um, you know, like a pretty regular claim from a departing of employee that, uh, was like workplace discrimination type stuff basically to keep it as general as possible. And it was going through the EEOC resolution process and as part of that, we would've typically before had like, you know, either either leveraged panel counsel provided by an insure or just regular outside counsel because I'm certainly not like an employment law expert, but like using a workflow process, mixing some of these different models, uh, allowed me to essentially like entirely redraft and draft a, a very, very good responsive brief to the EOC in three hours, which like I had calculated would probably have taken one, one worth before. Like I went to perplexity deep research function and had it like drum up all the law in Texas for this specific claim and I quickly site checked it and it was accurate and then I like exported that as like a PDF and uploaded that to, uh, white Shoe and also chat GPT and had like two drafts of a brief telling it to like act as an employment law attorney in this area of law, law and o and like telling it only to reference this case law so that it's not going out making up sites. It's like this is the, this is the base of knowledge I have to reference in order to craft this brief and then told it to like, you know, use Iraq and structure it like that. Essentially within three hours I had like a pretty incredible brief that would've taken a week to a week and a half and probably thousands of dollars of outside counsel spent. Um, so like that is currently possible and these tools are only gonna get better. I think that's good news for lawyers.",
