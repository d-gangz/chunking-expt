So we had a third training on the Employee Stock purchase plan and we made recordings of those trainings available. But we we didn't have the slide decks available separately because you do need the voice over particularly with respect to the espp because that's that's a prospectus.

I think, um, you know, I think the, the people tasked with recruiting the board or the ones that have to make their own assessment of that and about what the company needs, oftentimes that's a CEO. But one thing that's occurred to me in this conversation that um, uh, I I think is an interesting thought is, is there value in, in, in paneling a nominating corporate governance committee at an earlier stage? It's not something that's required until you're a public company. I tend to not be a fan of, I certainly don't want people building bureaucracy or building committees and structure that you're not going to use. Um, however, on that, the other side of that coin is when you impanel something like a committee and give it a charter, it tends to do things. And, you know, that may be a way, if you have the right people to, um, to join it and lead it to, to create some leadership and, and activism around thinking about this issue and being proactive in terms of how to shape the board in conjunction with the CEO's needs.",

You can design the chart to match what you think is important in the skillset. And, you know, depending on the honesty and the self-awareness of your board, you can have a pretty good discussion around that. And to the point made earlier by Alan, like, you could have that at the, at a board meeting and you, you'd need a director to lead that typically with a little bit of humility, right? Somebody who can come in and say, I know I don't get a five in every one of these categories. There's certain areas as I bring strength in other areas where I defer to others, and that's a healthy dynamic. I think you can set it up and have that conversation, but identifying sort of where the gaps are can be a really important way as a first step to then saying, okay, how do we apply this to our board and say, do we have the right people? Where do we need to go over time?",

I think you're doing it wrong if you're treating your board meeting as theater, uh, whether for the rest of your management team or for, you know, um, others that come along with your investors, um, you know, for the board to have an effective discussion for them to disagree with one another, um, to disagree with management and provide feedback, um, you not, not conflict, I'm not saying that in a negative way, but to have a healthy exchange and a dialogue that hopefully leads to a better answer. I think a more intimate environment is important. And so I would be very cautious about expanding the boardroom too much. It happens, you know, people don't wanna have that conversation and there can be a cultural impact of who's getting disinvited from the board meetings. That's real. Um, but I, you know, I do think, I, I forget who, who commented early. Maybe you just need to go have the direct conversation, Renee. Yeah, I think you do.",

          "quoted_text": "over that two year period, our outside counsel spend has decreased 93%. So we we're saving like $200,000 a year. And that our outside council firms probably aren't real, but like we go to AI as like a what you would treat like a junior or even mid-level associate. Some of these firms, which it blows my mind nowadays when you get bills for junior associates that are seven 50 bucks an hour. Um, so like we, we use that largely for like high stake stuff, obviously, like if it's a financing or an acquisition, we're still gonna use like real outside firms. But for the day-to-day stuff that most of us like at L Suite in-house departments, um, we just need to like expand our reach and speed as quickly and as cheaply as possible. And AI has in my mind, revolutionized the practice of law by being able to do that. So yeah, we've saved 92% over two years. And then in terms of like time saved, I'm sure I could like get, get an accurate or close to accurate hours per week saved. But I think the better metric is that given our like legal intake volume, our sales contract review volume and all that, we should be ending this year with five or six attorneys. We should currently have four, we only have two and we're not like crazy overworked or not more than anyone else and we don't plan on adding head count by the end of the year. So if you take that for what it's worth, it's like essentially one lawyer is doing the work of three by using AI Now",

Um, and that's certainly been come the case in my own work life and I found it incredibly useful. So I think treating it as a co co intelligence and just helping you think, even if you like, are most certain, you know, the answer to something like, you know, we all, we all have like implicit biases and having it critique those things to um, like re refine our reasoning is always useful.",

And so by putting up, whenever we have our q and a, the charter of mindful communication, which is like read the room, um, ask, ask questions that you really want answered, assume best intentions, it's, it's, you know, a few basics. Um, by doing that, um, people tend to reframe questions that could start off as hostile into construction, constructive questions, um, and other people in the room will call them out on it and say, reframe that. Um, and it'll get reframed and it leads to a, I think, a pretty healthy dialogue. What I think is really important is not shutting out avenues where these conversations happen, because they'll go underground. And I think it's really important to have your, your, um, your finger on the pulse of people's concerns. If there is, um, inequity that's half bubbling up somewhere, or if people are perceiving that something is unfair, and if you're not open to listening to it, it doesn't go away. It gets buried.
