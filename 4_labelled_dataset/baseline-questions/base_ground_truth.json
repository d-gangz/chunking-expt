So we had a third training on the Employee Stock purchase plan and we made recordings of those trainings available. But we we didn't have the slide decks available separately because you do need the voice over particularly with respect to the espp because that's that's a prospectus. It can be treated as an offering of stock. So you need to make sure it's up to date and make sure you have all of the information being delivered at the same time.

One is kind of technical hack, um, integrity, like, or your smart contracts good. Is your code good? Like obviously there's massive issues. There is, are your privacy incident response areas great. You know, you don't mess with that because like, again, that's, that's pretty existential and easy to fill a gap. Two criminal also something you don't mess with. You know, do you have, uh, A-M-L-K-Y-C sanctions in place? If you don't, you better have a darn good reason why you don't. If you're dealing with flow of funds, like, is your position justi justifiable with respect to, you know, are you, you know, theoretically helping a flow of dirty money? And this could be considered a national security risk. Like how are you dealing with that? You need to have an answer to that, and it needs to be a very good one. The third one, regulatory, like civil regulators, cryptos, it's no, no, uh, no secret that cryptos parts of crypto are kind of at war with the SEC. Well, how, how is that? Okay. How can you be at war with your regulator, if not your current regulator, if your unregulated potentially your future regulator with respect to your posture with the CFTC or the SEC? I would always say that at Maple, I spent a lot of time on a proactive, regular regulatory strategy that enabled me to feel comfortable that this was justifiable based on everything that existed. Whether that is law precedent, rules, guidance, like anything that was out there, I had a response. Now, would the SEC agree with my response? Probably not. But if put in front of a neutral arbiter like a judge, could I advocate for this position with a straight face? Could I convince potential strategic partners that I had done a degree of diligence on the regulatory risk? If those answers need to be, Yes, those answers absolutely need to be yes. If they're not, then you're in a problematic space, you know, basically from a practical viewpoint, but also potentially from an ethical viewpoint. Hmm. So there's a lot of gray area.

Whether it's diversity, bringing in more independence, um, bringing in more audit committee expertise, bringing in more operational skill sets to mentor the CEO. Um, we need to achieve all those objectives. And, you know, that's gonna involve some transitioning of board members. I, I'd like to hear from each of you what your, you know, continued interest level is in participating, but I'm gonna be talking to you about that dialogue and how we, how we order it. And I, I think trying to get people focused on why you're doing this in a way that is not personal to them and what, why it's good for the company is good table setting and just framing it and then building a plan where the succession that needs to happen is staged over time. So, you know, maybe one seed is surrendered every year, and that's known in advance. You know, we're gonna move out our series A director next year, and we're gonna replace them with, um, an independent diverse board member. And then in the second year, as we're a year away from IPO, we're gonna move out our series B board member and we're gonna replace 'em with an audit committee chair. Um, I think also having a plan, um, you know, can, can let the other directors participate in the plan, and it doesn't feel like that first person that got tapped is the one that's getting picked on.",

Like, I think you need to speak about this in, in, you know, ways that your sales guy can understand. And if you're talking about regulatory issues or implications in a way that only lawyers will understand, it's really not gonna resonate. Where if you, you know, give them concrete examples of traders who have actually served prison time because of something stupid that they put in a chat like that is a lot more impactful.

And, um, I, I see companies make the mistake of being too generous with either observation rights that are contractual or worse with just inviting people to the board meeting that don't have observation rights as if it's theater. Um, I think you're doing it wrong if you're treating your board meeting as theater, uh, whether for the rest of your management team or for, you know, um, others that come along with your investors, um, you know, for the board to have an effective discussion for them to disagree with one another, um, to disagree with management and provide feedback, um, you not, not conflict, I'm not saying that in a negative way, but to have a healthy exchange and a dialogue that hopefully leads to a better answer. I think a more intimate environment is important. And so I would be very cautious about expanding the boardroom too much. It happens, you know, people don't wanna have that conversation and there can be a cultural impact of who's getting disinvited from the board meetings. That's real.
