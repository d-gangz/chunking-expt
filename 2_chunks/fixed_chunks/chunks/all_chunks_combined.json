    "text": "Welcome everybody. Um, my name is Heather Wallinger, event host here at the L Suite. Our panel today will focus on prompting with precision leveraging AI responsibly as in-house counsel. We have a really great set of speakers for here today. I'm pleased to welcome Tommy Tavares Ferrera, chief Strategy Officer at Law Trades. We have, we have Jason Satoma, general Counsel at Tiffin Ag in Access, and we have Alex Rendells, general counsel at Jasper ai, a really big thank you to our sponsor for today's session, uh, law Trades for making this event possible. So that is it for me, Tommy. I will hand it over to you to get us started. Thank you. Hi everybody. I am Tommy Avara Spira. I'm the Chief Strategy Officer at Law Trades, as Heather just said. And for those who haven't worked with us yet, law Trades is, uh, a marketplace for on demand legal talent. We're the go-to partner for companies that need vetted high caliber lawyers, legal ops, pros, contract managers or paralegals. Think of this as the legal team behind your legal team. Later on in today's session, we'll launch a call with a, an offer unique to L Suite members. If you're interested in a free legal operation strategy session, followed by a personalized assessment and roadmap customized to your team, you'll have a chance to opt in. And with that, I'd love to pass it to Jason and Alex to introduce themselves. Hi, I'm Jason. I am a general counsel of a collection of software startups, predominantly in FinTech ai. Alex, over to you. Yep. I'm Alex. Uh, I'm the general counsel of Jasper ai. We're a marketing AI company for enterprises. Um, so pretty familiar with developing and deploying AI and then using it personally in our legal workflows in-house as well. Excellent. Thank you both. So before we dive in, let me set the stage. AI is moving way faster than a lot of legal teams are comfortable with, and prompting is the tip of that very powerful momentum. Um, if you've ever had a sales team ping legal with a question like, can we just use this vendor's paper, um, without context, without details, or maybe even without a link to that contract, then you know that feeling of what it's like when you don't get a good question, every answer feels wrong. And that's kind of what prompting with AI is exactly like, so we wanna get really good at asking the right question and give the right context and details. So now that AI is answering questions at scale, the stakes are really big and that's why today is about how we ask those questions better. So, um, we wanna use these tools, smart and safe. Um, let's get into it. Jason, can you share a case where sharpening a prompt, um, led to a materially better output? Yeah, sure. So I guess to preface this, this was early AI days. I was probably using chat GPT and didn't have a ton of practice, but one time I was trying to recall the present consent to future events rules in Delaware. So I asked chat GPT, basically just that the output was predictably awful",

I was probably using chat GPT and didn't have a ton of practice, but one time I was trying to recall the present consent to future events rules in Delaware. So I asked chat GPT, basically just that the output was predictably awful. Uh, going back I tried to sharpen it up a bit and I asked how many days in advance the prospective action can a board or stockholders' consent to those future actions? I told it to assume Delaware law site to statutes or clarifying case law. It, uh, oh. And I also told it to discuss the full chain of reasoning prior to concluding. 'cause sometimes you can get sharper responses 'cause it's, it's not thinking, it's just reasoning through words in real time. Uh, answer wound up being 60 days in case anyone's interested. And I think the takeaway is that you can get pretty far with even basic context. Also worth mentioning that the cited law was wrong. It gave me a correct quote, but the wrong law. So that just further highlights the need to verify all the odd outputs. And Jason, I'll ask a a quick follow up before I go over to Alex. Um, when, when you're in that instance where the citation is wrong, if you don't have expertise, how do, how do you know what's wrong? That's somewhat that, that, that's a big problem. If you don't have a bit of a BS meter on the topic in question, you can't really know it's wrong. So you have to view it as sort of a Google something that helps you figure out what you don't know. And if it's important enough or risky enough, you'd then have to escalate it to somebody who does Trust but verify Trust, but verify Just to verify. Excellent. And Alex, what criteria are you using to know that a prompt is hitting the mark",

And Alex, what criteria are you using to know that a prompt is hitting the mark? Yeah, I think the most recent models that have come out from OpenAI, Google philanthropic, um, have become better and better at getting pretty close to a perfect answer. Honestly, like I've found, um, the legal reasoning for most questions I ask are now 85 to 90% accurate. But one thing to be continually conscious of is that if you're asking it to cite sources, it will still at times hallucinate those sources. There's a, there's ways you can improve that, especially if you're using a model from one of the model providers that allows, um, live search grounding using Google or perplexity as like a deep research function. And that gets a little better to the mark in terms of citing accurate sources. You still have to be careful about that, but I still find that it might give you, you know, like accurate elements of breach of contract in Massachusetts and it's, it's dead accurate. And then the sources it cite might not be, um, the best sources to cite or might some might be inaccurate, but that is getting better and better. Do you have any sort of methodology to what you do when you do come up with a good prompt and you want to save it or share it? Yeah, definitely. So there are plenty of tools that would do this for you nowadays. I'm sure people on the call use them or aware of them. You can also, like, for a long time I just kept a note file with prompts that I would copy and paste into chat GPT. That's pretty good",

You can also, like, for a long time I just kept a note file with prompts that I would copy and paste into chat GPT. That's pretty good. The framework I think about for creating prompts is entirely stolen from, um, a book that came out last year by Ethan Molik, he's a researcher at, and the book's title co intelligence. Um, and it's pretty short and easy to get your hands on. I think it's less than 200 pages. But one of the things he talks about in terms of crafting good prompts to have the best re responses from AI is to give it first a role to play. So in the legal context, um, having it, telling it to act as an attorney and not just any attorney, but trying to narrow down on the specific expertise you're wanting it to have. Um, and that substantially improves prompts and you can just put that in the beginning of the prompt or, or bury it in the system prompt Once again, there are plenty of tools out there nowadays that will do this for you so you don't have to know what you're doing. Um, but that helps a lot in the get go. And before I, I I pivot to Jason a quick follow. Um, it used to be that the order of where you were asking the question was important. For example, if you put it first and then you put context later, or if you put context in the question, do you find there's any magic to whether you're putting the question then loading in the context or not, doesn't matter anymore? Um, that's a, that's a great point. I still put it before in chat gt even you, if you have their plus plan, I believe you can create custom GPTs that allow you to bury it in the system prompts so that any question you ask it automatically is incorporating that context. That's helpful",

That's helpful. Um, but quite frankly, I think the models are keep, keep getting better and better at this. And you can probably include it anywhere. Uh, you could attach a file, like if you have notes for prompts you want to use in a Word doc, you could just attach that. Um, the, the models themselves are getting very good at understanding user intent. You can have grammatical errors, you can totally misstate the mark on like what even law you're trying to research. And it'll typically do a pretty good job of figuring out what you mean Does catch my reads right through my typo. Um, so Jason, what, what tools are you leaning on for prompting, I guess, uh, I don't have to think too hard. Thankfully I use GC ai. There's a lot of tools that like it and you ask it what you're thinking, you provide some context, you click the magic, fix my prompt button and it blows it up into this multi-paragraph beautiful wonder prompt. So I don't have to think about it that hard. When I used to, I don't know if this is still the case, but at one point in time, Claude was better at writing like the human, so I would use Claude to create a really good prompt and then I would plug that into chat GPT or another model and go from there with pretty good results. Also, I think a pro tip is if you are really not getting outputs that are helpful, and if, and if it keeps missing the mark in the response, um, you can ask, um, for, for whatever tool you're using, can you help me to write a better prompt here? And I think again, like the more context you can add, the better that the, the prompt's going to be, right",

Um, but, but as we said, like even even that like relying on the tool to give you that, um, is gonna help you. So Jason, now let's talk about, um, some of the risks, right? Like we're we're talking about prompting, we're talking about giving context, we're talking about how you get better at asking the right question so you get the right outputs, but in reality there are still some risks. And, um, what do you think is most likely to cause something misleading or to cause a risky output? Yeah, so there's a couple different answers to that. Some of them are more technical than I'm able to provide and others are more contextual. So I think first off, a lot of people are treating these tools as if they're subject matter experts in areas that they don't understand. And I think that's inherently problematic and dangerous. I feel like a broken record, but I keep going to the, you need to be able, you need to be capable of falsifying the output in order for it to be safe for you to rely on the output with without bringing in other humans. And so I guess you, yeah, that, that's the big one. And then you need to add context and specificity to prompts and you need to specify what your outcome should be, particularly what a lot of people, myself included, occasionally you ask it leading questions such as I think this is the rule, I think this is what happens. Do you agree? And again, because these things aren't really thinking that's, that's a dangerous way to ask a question",

And then like, Hey, are you like, are you familiar with the languages that they speak there?

One of the ways that I do it is force it to show its thinking. So some of the new reasoning models, Gemini 2.5 Pro will do this automatically and it provides a little dropdown box that shows you how the system was thinking itself.

I don't even have to spell out like issue rule analysis, conclusion it know what IRAC is and it'll, it'll structure its response that way and then at least you can go through, you're like, did it catch the question that I was even asking to spot the issue?

Um, another easy hack I've found is using models that are fine tuned for coding use cases that seems odd and it might not pro provide the best, um, like written English output itself, but the legal reasoning I found is the strongest not to be. I'm guessing it's because like years ago I read that the highest performers on the LSAT in a bar exam were math majors in college, which seems counterintuitive at first because you would think like English and history majors and philosophy major would be the best, but math is just like pure representational logic. Um, so those people should be able to do logical reasoning in the best and the models kind of bear that out when you're using a math heavy or coding heavy model, it seems to be able to walk through discreet, deductive logical reasoning better than just jumping into chat GBT raw and trying to uh, figure it out from there. Um, but then taking a step back, like Jason mentioned GCA ai, we use GC ai, we also used, uh, um, a tool called White Shoe ai and then we use Ivo AI and all three of those, like for somebody who doesn't want to dig in and learn all of these, uh, annoying geeky nuances, these tools do all that for you. They're selecting, most likely they're selecting the best models for you, um, when to use them and how to prompt them. And it helps a ton. I'll share in the chat those three that we use.

Do you find that the, um, the way that you're asking it to take on a persona or, or using logic-based responses, is that how you build confidence, um, in your responses or is there any other methodology? The specific question is like how do you build confidence and certainty in the response? And it sounds like you touched on that a bit, but if you have any, or Jason, if you have any other pro tips on building that confidence in the response? I think so going back to Ethan Malik's book co Intelligence, one of the things he says is, um, to begin using AI constantly and you'll, you'll start noticing where it's strong, where it's weak, and that itself will build your confidence. I'm definitely a power user of ai. There's nothing I do now at work that doesn't incorporate ai, um, like literally every single question I'm receiving and responding to, unless it's live on a call like this where I can't. And even even then we use transcribing notes, um, notes through these tools that, you know, we'll do speech to text nowadays, which are pretty good. Um, but the more you use it, I think the more comfortable you'll get. And even if it seems like something that, ah, I don't need to use this, I know this, um, like the back of my hand, it's useful for you to build up the confidence to use the tool so that then when a problem comes along that it's like really well suited for, you can use that. And then just also keep it in mind that these tools, you should treat them as like a junior associate at a law firm or like an entry level or they're pretty good and that they'll give you a lot of good content, but at the end of the day, you're still the actual human and the attorney and you should be checking it",

So we've taken the audience through prompting, getting them comfortable with maybe how to prompt and I see the chats going up with a ton of resources and there are some takeaways that people will have, but I think also one barrier to entry for folks and one friction point is naturally like not knowing what the best practices or guardrails are. So I think that's something we should pivot to now. Um, Alex, why don't you kick us off with talking us through internal guardrails. It sounds like you all are very comfy over there with these tools. It sounds like you all are probably like utilizing them all day long. How did you get folks comfy with it and what kind of guardrails do you put in? Definitely, yeah, so it helps that we are a company run by, um, executives who are super AI focused. I mean, we're an AI company ourselves and a lot of it is they want us to, um, like eat our own product, like what we're selling. And because of that we have like an internal mandate to, for everybody across the organization, if you're an engineer or lawyer finance, to use AI as much as you can basically to increase efficiency, lower costs. Um, so in terms of from executive buy-in, it was, it was mandated so it was easy to get buy-in there. Um, we don't, you might find it ironic, but we don't like have a formal AI use policy. I've seen those floating around. Um, in fact, I find it funny that like, uh, uh, default form one on Westlaw itself, practical law includes Jasper. It's one of the recommended tools",

But you know, I think it's good if you're, especially if you're a big organization or one that regularly handles sensitive data like, like FinTech industry or finance industry or biotech to implement some type of internal company policy. But if you're not, um, as long as like there's some like general agreement within the organization that you're going to either have enterprise accounts that have agreements in place not to train the models on your data that you input into it, um, or just in your personal accounts that you have on these, most of those include settings now as long as you're paying for the, but not just on the free models that allow you to go in and talk with that on and off from a legal specific standpoint, one of the guardrails that my team, uh, is a bare minimum is that if we're using a public tool like chat GPT or anthropic to always, um, obs obfuscate the like client or the company information. So use Acme Co instead of Jasper. Uh, the tools like White Shoe and GC AI do this naturally. They like encrypt data in transit at rest and white shoe even like hashes it so that the LILM isn't even seeing like only the user's able to see it. Um, so those types of things get me comfortable that one, you're not sacrificing attorney-client privilege, but then two, like the only person who's ever gonna see the actual company information is, um, is yourself.

Uh, super prompt is a bit of a misnomer. I created this in preparation for this panel. I didn't put the most effort into it. So generally speaking, I tried to create a prompt that provides as much generally applicable context as possible, organizes how the response should be laid out, as you can see here, tells it how I want it to think and when applicable tells it how to research. 'cause sometimes there are, sometimes it executes brief searches, but a lot of times with these deeper research projects, that is not what you want. So you, I don't recommend just using this for everything. This is more of just an exercise in thinking how to pull these prompts together. And, uh, I guess furthermore, this is probably more tailored to more basic tools and less deep reasoning models because as I understand it a lot, a lot of models now do some of these steps by themselves. But y this is here, if anyone finds it helpful, and I understand this is or will be soon circulated to both here. It it has already been. And I guess staying on the, the topic here, Jason, what, what does auditing look like, um, for you and your team? Do you actually audit what people use for prompts? Do you have a library and, and do you, do you, uh, do you ever look at what, what's being used as prompts? Uh, so we don't audit.

Just we had like a offsite hackathon for our legal team and finance team. And, um, one of the tools or work workflows we used was, uh, through Zapier we created a Zap, which it's like a, Zapier is like a pretty inexpensive automation platform if you're not familiar with it. It's, it's pretty user friendly. You might have to have some technical experience with it, but, uh, it's kind of drag and drop and, and using, um, our Slack API keys that we're able to link, uh, to it and then open AI's models through their API keys and Zapier.

But basic like billing finance questions, it does answer and it's, it's pretty accurate. Um, and one of the things we did to save us time as well is we like downloaded, we used the Slack API and scanned the last year of messages in this channel and directed OpenAI or chat JT to figure out like what the most common questions were, who they were most commonly routed to, what the responses were. So we grounded the, um, chat bot's responses in that knowledge from the last year's context as well. And it's been live now for a couple weeks and it's pretty great.

Um, we, we got a question about, uh, being comfortable with inputting sensitive client data into, um, enterprise accounts. Say for example, OpenAI, I think we touched on that a little, um, which is about systems that encrypt things, you know, and or anonymizing, like, like for example, Alex, you said making something Acme not your company. Um, are those the best practices for, for not, uh, putting client data into these models? Yeah, I think, um, for the general purpose models like open AI and philanthropic, it's, if you're wanting to be extra cautious, you can always just use Acme or something like that. Um, that requires a bit more of a manual lift. It might be slower and inefficient because you're having to do that every time, especially if you're uploading documents to it, you're having to, you know, find and replace any usage of, uh, confidential company information to do that. Um, but yeah, like honestly, the easy answer is you'll probably just want to use a tool like White Shoe or GCI where it allows you to go in and create a company profile or client profiles if you need more than one. And you enter all this information and then the M'S responses throughout the platform automatically incorporate that information and it's encrypted and like remains secure too, which is useful and speeds up processes and makes it more accurate, all that stuff.

    "text": ". Um, are those the best practices for, for not, uh, putting client data into these models? Yeah, I think, um, for the general purpose models like open AI and philanthropic, it's, if you're wanting to be extra cautious, you can always just use Acme or something like that. Um, that requires a bit more of a manual lift. It might be slower and inefficient because you're having to do that every time, especially if you're uploading documents to it, you're having to, you know, find and replace any usage of, uh, confidential company information to do that. Um, but yeah, like honestly, the easy answer is you'll probably just want to use a tool like White Shoe or GCI where it allows you to go in and create a company profile or client profiles if you need more than one. And you enter all this information and then the M'S responses throughout the platform automatically incorporate that information and it's encrypted and like remains secure too, which is useful and speeds up processes and makes it more accurate, all that stuff. Yeah, I guess just to add on to that, my view has always been if the, if your team has gotten comfortable that the InfoSec protections are there and you're comfortable that the legal protections are there, then I, I treat these things like any other vendor. There's of course gonna be incremental risk anytime you expand your circle of trust at all. But I, I don't think that these things are that different from any other vendors is my takeaway. Okay. So we've been through prompts, we touched on agents very quickly. We talked about guardrails. There are a lot of people trying to discern in the chat, which is the right tool for them. So let's take them through tool selection when it comes to oversight, tool selection, what you do, Jason, like what can you take people through on, on, on human oversight? Um, you know, any advice on like what they can do there? Yeah, I'll just regurgitate some of the other things I've said already, but I think you need to have, you need, you want to have a BS meter on the subjects you're asking it about. If you do not, then you should instead be using it to figure out what you don't know and frame a more intelligent question to somebody who does, uh, when you can do that. Or I suppose even if you can, you should try to ask questions that allow you to spot check the outputs as well, and that helps you to falsify responses. But I suppose the, the general point is that our job as AI augmented attorneys is knowing what to ask when and how, and that job itself cannot be yet replicated by ai. So yeah. Fantastic. And Alex, um, uh, uh, hopefully like you, you know, you've touched on this a little bit, but do you have any further insight on how you decide which AI platform to do for, for which task?

Any, any magic there? Yeah, so I would say the default program nowadays we use for contract redlining is Ivo and essentially everything else, it's uh, white, it's been a white shoe ai and that's largely because it just like, one, it's super cost effective, um, but two, it does a lot of this stuff we're talking about on the backend without you having to really like know coding or how to prompt specifically, it'll enhance your prompts. Um, if you go into like their chat bot for instance, you can, there's a dropdown of like the practice area you want it to be an expert in. So I know if I'm asking it about a term sheet for some financing, I can go in and select the, just like a law firm, the emerging companies and venture capital practice group. And it's actually like adjusted and it's a fine tuned model for that. And that's like substantially better responses than if I just go into chat GPT and ask a question. Um, so there's a bit of that. And then I think internally, just like budget wise, we're super cost conscious, so we don't want tool creep, we don't want a ton of tools that do the same thing. Um, quite frankly, by the end of this year, we're probably gonna churn from either GCI or Ivo because they're both starting to cross paths and like do the same thing as the, as each other and we're just gonna have to determine which one's the best at doing it and save eight grand a year or whatever. Interesting question. Um, does anyone have walled off instances by department? For example, HR or legal or any other department",

Interesting question. Um, does anyone have walled off instances by department? For example, HR or legal or any other department? I've never heard of that, but that's an interesting question we got. I think I'd probably have to ask a follow-up question to ever asked it by what they mean by walled off. If it's like a private instance of a, you know, cloud hosted model just on your internal workspace at your company that only certain lawyers or finance people can access. If that's the question, we certainly don't, that would be really expensive, difficult to implement. But with that being said, I'm sure there are large legal departments and really sophisticated companies, probably Fortune 20 companies that prioritize that type of use case. For most of us on this call though, it's probably too cumbersome to implement something like that. And tool selection itself probably helps with that. Like Jasper is a marketing AI tool and like as much as I'd love to say it's great for lawyers, it it's horrible. Um, so like I don't ever use our own product, but like our marketing team uses it like crazy and like similarly they're not gonna ever use GC AI or White Shoe. It's like that kind of helps wall it off itself, but they're certainly not like privately hosted models that only Jasper has access to. Yeah. Uh, I'm likely speaking well over my skis here, but I think the only tool that most of my company has access to is chat GPT and I, I believe that that is relatively segregated by specific individual account, but if if that's not the case, then I'm just wrong. So there's that. So I am going to bring us, um, to perhaps like the most exciting part. Uh, let's talk about how utilizing AI can actually save us time. Um, does anyone, uh, uh, actually, sorry Alex, let's start with you.

Yeah, definitely. So I joined Jasper three years ago, um, before chat GBT became publicly available, uh, which partially obliterated our downmarket business at Jasper, but that's okay. Um, we pivoted, but before then, and probably for the six months thereafter, chat, GBT and the generally available tools were pretty horrendous at doing legal work. Like I think whenever they test him on the bar, they were hardly passing or like not passing. Since then, like over the last 18 months to 24 months, the general tools have become super useful and then there's all these legal AI startups that have spr it up with specific tools. And beginning about two years ago we started like heavily implementing, um, tool usage for AI within our legal department. And over that two year period, our outside counsel spend has decreased 93%. So we we're saving like $200,000 a year. And that our outside council firms probably aren't real, but like we go to AI as like a what you would treat like a junior or even mid-level associate. Some of these firms, which it blows my mind nowadays when you get bills for junior associates that are seven 50 bucks an hour. Um, so like we, we use that largely for like high stake stuff, obviously, like if it's a financing or an acquisition, we're still gonna use like real outside firms. But for the day-to-day stuff that most of us like at L Suite in-house departments, um, we just need to like expand our reach and speed as quickly and as cheaply as possible.

And then in terms of like time saved, I'm sure I could like get, get an accurate or close to accurate hours per week saved. But I think the better metric is that given our like legal intake volume, our sales contract review volume and all that, we should be ending this year with five or six attorneys. We should currently have four, we only have two and we're not like crazy overworked or not more than anyone else and we don't plan on adding head count by the end of the year. So if you take that for what it's worth, it's like essentially one lawyer is doing the work of three by using AI Now That, that is like quite a win. Uh, Jason, how about you? I don't have, uh, specific figures like Alex does, but I suppose more anecdotally, I recently maybe two months ago closed an m and a transaction just by myself using AI tools opposite a full Kirkland and Alice bench. So that is not something I could do unassisted by ai. I probably saved, it wasn't the biggest transaction, it might have cost $30,000 through big law or $15,000 through medium law service providers, but it's really nice to be able to just internalize things like that. AI assisted, No, I think, I think you're not giving yourself enough credit. That's really impressive. I mean, if we got to a world where this could assist in lobbing off like huge m and a expenses, because obviously law firms have been using this sort of tooling for a really long time to do this, right?

Um, before we close Jason, what is one piece of advice you would give someone who just started looking at these tools, prompting, um, getting comfortable, wants to give their team, you know, a speech about it. What kind of advice do you wanna give to someone? Uh, pick your tools wisely. I'm definitely, I'm probably not the best at that, but I, I like what I have and I'd found success with it. Uh, be smart about how you ask questions. I won't go into the whole spiel I've recycled a few times already, but that is very important. And don't trust outputs. Verify them, Trust them, verify. Alex, what about you? What advice would you give somebody? Yeah, I'm once again just gonna rip from Ethan Malik's book, which I'd recommend anyone read. It's incredible. But I'd say first like, treat AI as a co intelligence. Um, he projects that like within five years humans will become cyborgs, meaning like we're almost everything we do in work is augmented to some degree by degree an ai. Um, and that's certainly been come the case in my own work life and I found it incredibly useful. So I think treating it as a co co intelligence and just helping you think, even if you like, are most certain, you know, the answer to something like, you know, we all, we all have like implicit biases and having it critique those things to um, like re refine our reasoning is always useful. Um, and then I'd also just be comfortable with like good enough responses from ai. That's probably my second point",

It's like, at first I was like, oh, you know, it's not passing the bar at a 99% pass rate, but most lawyers aren't either. Um, most lawyers like I, if I'm hiring someone, I'm happy if they're consistently outputting 80 to 85% results. Now I could say human, it's like if the AI's doing that, but for 20 bucks a month it's pretty incredible and like I can improve the other 20% to make it better. And then three, I think like the more that you can ingest kind of like the geeky, nerdy AI stuff through newsletters or videos or whatever, the better. Like, uh, a few weeks ago Sam Altman had like a really interesting interview on a panel he was on. Um, and uh, the interviewer asked him what they've noticed at Open AI about different generations and how they use ai and he commented how like the older generations are using, um, AI as you know, the memes that we used to see 20 years ago from our grandparents asking questions to Google that like didn't make any sense. But like ironically now, like that's actually like a pretty ideal way to use AI for someone who doesn't need it for some specialized use case. It's just like treating like another human asking it questions. They're using it like that.

Like rather than going to their computer or their phone as like their main source of computation and operating system, these people are just starting to use like ai, um, because they've grown up with it, it's intuitive for them.

Let me ans let me ask one, uh, that just came up Jason. Um, specifically what tool did you use for, for that m and a um, uh, support? Yeah, I should have provided some more details. So again, I'm not the expert in which tool to pick. I use GCAI, it helped that I am an m and a attorney by training. I've run lots of deals, so give me most pretty decent tools and I can run with my little robot minions and close deals so that, that may not be the best approach, but it worked very well for me is all I can say from my anecdote. Well, and I think you're overlaying it with what's important, which is you had the expertise to be able to see that the outputs like, like that domain expertise. So someone who maybe doesn't have it, that may be like you might have that edge, which is I think extremely fair in a lot of what we've been talking about today. Certainly if you don't have the expertise to run a certain kind of transaction or process, AI won't give you that expertise, but if you do, it's a very good resource. That's right. And we've all been saying, yeah. So, um, Alex, this, this goes back to something you said, uh, a little bit earlier, like on note taking for example, I think we're all sort of running Zoom AI or granola or some flavor of, of, uh, an automated note taker. Um, when you're utilizing a tool like that, how do both of you get comfortable with preserving privilege and confidentiality",

Um, specifically what tool did you use for, for that m and a um, uh, support? Yeah, I should have provided some more details. So again, I'm not the expert in which tool to pick. I use GCAI, it helped that I am an m and a attorney by training. I've run lots of deals, so give me most pretty decent tools and I can run with my little robot minions and close deals so that, that may not be the best approach, but it worked very well for me is all I can say from my anecdote. Well, and I think you're overlaying it with what's important, which is you had the expertise to be able to see that the outputs like, like that domain expertise. So someone who maybe doesn't have it, that may be like you might have that edge, which is I think extremely fair in a lot of what we've been talking about today. Certainly if you don't have the expertise to run a certain kind of transaction or process, AI won't give you that expertise, but if you do, it's a very good resource. That's right. And we've all been saying, yeah. So, um, Alex, this, this goes back to something you said, uh, a little bit earlier, like on note taking for example, I think we're all sort of running Zoom AI or granola or some flavor of, of, uh, an automated note taker. Um, when you're utilizing a tool like that, how do both of you get comfortable with preserving privilege and confidentiality? Yeah, the easy answer is I don't get comfortable and I haven't, we, we've honestly been trying to restrict the Zoom recording or gran, we use granola internally. Granola currently doesn't have a feature to like auto delete some period, like a retention timeline basically. I wish it did. Um, so we just try to coach our people like not to use that in a board meeting obviously, or like anything even slightly lower stakes than that. Um, but with that being said, it's like we're certainly not taking a restrictive stance saying you can't use this because the fact of the matter is it's, it's saving people tons of time. It's a more accurate note taker than humans certainly are. It allows people to focus on the human being across the screen from them in a meeting rather than focus on taking notes. It's like those things in my mind far outweigh the risks as long as you're like being careful. Like if, you know, we haven't had a data breach, but if I'm on the phone and we're talking about a data breach with my ciso, I'm not gonna have granola recording, uh, the message there. Or if I do, I'm gonna immediately, I'm gonna take the notes, maybe print them out or keep them in some physical form and delete like the transcript of it from the servers. Something like that. Yeah, this is an issue we've discussed, perhaps not at length, but it's, it's come up where there are obvious discovery implications for anything that I'll use",

Yeah, this is an issue we've discussed, perhaps not at length, but it's, it's come up where there are obvious discovery implications for anything that I'll use. Zoom AI as an example, just automatically saves and emails out to everybody where I master of the universe. I would make it so that you can ask it questions based on what it's sort of stored. You can get the answers and then you use those notes yourself rather than just these AI summarized call transcripts, which are just there forever, but may maybe that'll be a feature one day and maybe it already is and I just haven't figured out how to use it. But that, that's what I would prefer. I I'm gonna pivot a little bit to CLMs. So the question is largely around like AI tools and CLMs, um, and it's it and it's, is there, is there an easier way to redline contracts, for example, utilizing like an AI word plugin versus going the full route of A CLM implementation? And this is probably largely an opinion and largely based on the size and scale and scope of your organization, but if either of you find, um, utilizing an AI tool, uh, to be maybe easier than that implementation or any insights there? Yeah, I definitely have an opinion and it's not overly positive. Um, so we implemented a CLM solution. The biggest one probably that you guys are all familiar with, um, coming up on two and a half years ago and during that time had like a bake off between three of the best ones. The only one at that time that I found that was good at uh, like contract redlining was luminance, but they were so early at all the other things that we didn't actually end up using them and I didn't need a contract red liner at that point in time and it wasn't up to speed",

Like it wasn't as good as the current ones are, like Ivo or GC ai. Um, but like the large legacy CLM solutions I have found to be very weak. Like you can, it almost seems like they're just bolting on AI so that they can market themselves as AI companies. Um, ironclad link squares these people and the redline tools aren't good. If I was them, I would just acquire one of these startups honestly and integrate it. Um, but uh, hope hopefully they get there because it'd certainly be easier to just have a one-stop shop where like all your contracts are negotiated and redlined.

Absolutely. Uh, we got something that's very, very highly upvoted, so I have to ask it. Do the GCI users find much difference between using that platform or just a paid GPT? Um, I think we covered a lot of this and what's very unique about GPT and that it's, it's, you know, giving in, uh, GCI rather in that it's giving you, um, prompt, you know, recommendations and that it does have like, that we're built on for redline. So it sounds like there's a bit of uniqueness there, but it was uploaded highly. Anything else to overlay on why you might pick a tool that is tailor, uh, purpose built for, for legal? Uh, GC AI is kind of just awesome. So the precision and the responses is very impressive. Cecilia sort of demoed it to me herself and she was explaining to me that the types of, uh, like quotes and end quotes even like have to be specific or they consider that a miss in their internal testing. It also, I'm, I'm speaking to the one tool I use the most obviously, but it also knows which parts of which prompt to send to which underlying models, which is hugely helpful, particularly if you're less tech savvy such as myself, where I'm, I'm not breaking apart tasks, sending them to different machines and then aggregating that at the end",

Yeah, so I am an ai, uh, optimist. You haven't already been able to tell. There are, there are the doomers that think it's gonna like end all legal practice or whatnot.

So yeah, a year from now it could totally revolutionize it, but I think like a quick, an even if that doesn't happen, a quick anecdote using like existing technology, it's like we two months ago faced, um, you know, like a pretty regular claim from a departing of employee that, uh, was like workplace discrimination type stuff basically to keep it as general as possible. And it was going through the EEOC resolution process and as part of that, we would've typically before had like, you know, either either leveraged panel counsel provided by an insure or just regular outside counsel because I'm certainly not like an employment law expert, but like using a workflow process, mixing some of these different models, uh, allowed me to essentially like entirely redraft and draft a, a very, very good responsive brief to the EOC in three hours, which like I had calculated would probably have taken one, one worth before",

Like I went to perplexity deep research function and had it like drum up all the law in Texas for this specific claim and I quickly site checked it and it was accurate and then I like exported that as like a PDF and uploaded that to, uh, white Shoe and also chat GPT and had like two drafts of a brief telling it to like act as an employment law attorney in this area of law, law and o and like telling it only to reference this case law so that it's not going out making up sites. It's like this is the, this is the base of knowledge I have to reference in order to craft this brief and then told it to like, you know, use Iraq and structure it like that. Essentially within three hours I had like a pretty incredible brief that would've taken a week to a week and a half and probably thousands of dollars of outside counsel spent. Um, so like that is currently possible and these tools are only gonna get better. I think that's good news for lawyers. That is so impressive. Um, I wanna say that this conversation today has made it abundantly clear that these tools are here to stay. Uh, prompting is no longer a niche skill. All of these, uh, you know, concept tools, um, skills are becoming table stakes. And so I wanna give a huge thank you to Alex and Jason for giving us their expertise. There's a lot of takeaways for everyone to have. We hope you're leaving, feeling inspired and maybe you'll even try out a few new prompts. Thank you everybody. Thanks Tommy, Jason, and Alex for, um, sharing your time and your expertise with our group today and, uh, to launch rates for making this event possible.

I would say or or probably three quarters of the way through and that was in January of 2021. We went public in on April 15th 2021. So we just made it before in the market completely changed had a very big IPO, but we did it very very fast and recursion is part of the new wave of tech enabled drug Discovery companies. We have an AI machine learning platform that we use with image-based processing to develop essentially maps of human biology, and we now have four compounds in the clinic. So we're judged as a biopharma company as well. I'll leave it at that deaf. You can introduce yourself and I'm Jeff lassage. I'm one of the founders of liquid stock we Provide structured Equity financing to free IPO companies. It's really a hybrid between a loan and a sale. And we wanted Luisa here to make all the general counsels. Who are Facing all the pressure be really jealous of someone who got through her process of three months. I don't think I don't think you should be jealous. It was very very hard. You know, we we took about four months to do all of the preparation drafting ES1. I mean you name it. It was incredibly fast everything we do at recursion. We do fast to a very high standard as well, but I don't recommend it. So don't be don't be jealous. Actually. The silver lining of current macroeconomic conditions is that you do have a lot of time to prepare for your IPO. Yeah times times in this year. Yeah in both directions. Yeah. So, you know given the state of the market right now Jeff with the IPO window essentially closed and no certainty on when it may reopen. How do you how do you think IPO preparation should be handled in terms of equity so from that perspective and also just to back up a little bit.

And so that first what what we saw references that first bite of the apple is amending the RSU plan one time typically is viewed is not causing the IRS to look at that plan and say well we think there's no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture. and so you're allowing some segment of that RSU class to actually accelerate convert those rsues into shares and potentially give them a liquidity event, whether that's thirst, you know, a structured Equity Finance or Through a tender offer. And so then the the question comes if you've done that once. Can you do it again? And and I think most of the lawyers who are advising the companies in the room and they accountants and tax advisors are saying you cannot. It's interesting to look now, though. At this time and think about how long a time period we potentially have to see whether or not people are going to take a different position on that now, but the main thing is if you're RC plan goes away. You've got a bunch of questions. You've got to answer and on the top of the list is okay. What's the accounting charge to re-up all of your existing employees and oftentimes, that's a massive hit. Because those the value of of those rsues is grown tremendously over time. Maybe it's come down. So but even in that in that view at the time, you're CFO is trying to keep your balance sheet pristine and one of the room. Yeah, so you need to also keep in mind how much pressure is coming from the employees for liquidity event. That depends on how large your employee bases how long they've been with the company",

You know how much the valuation has changed. So one thing I'm curious about is had what companies do you think have done this? Well, how many you know who has done it poorly on who is maybe in a sort of waiting? Waiting stage. I mean it's an interesting question. On on I think the companies that have managed as well. They're all. All the companies now, I feel like are trying to do the right thing employee first culture. Mm-hmm retaining Talent retaining Talent biggest attracting Talent managing your 409a. I think stripe. Did a really good job over time thinking about that and then providing liquidity when you know section annual tenders. And they did those tenders actually at the same valuation as the last round preferred, which is very different that if you go back over time and look at like uber and there was a 20% discount and so they're actually valuing that common security at the same as the preferred which is giving the employees a better deal than they should get. That I should when they should what could they could? Yeah, I mean the reality is if a preferred investor went around and turned so that security the next day. It's very different than the common. Yeah, and so I think I think they they're two lessons out of that. one of which is that they took some of that. liquidity pent-up liquidity demand out of the stock earlier, right? And then the second piece is they treated their employees in a way that They didn't feel like it was unfair. Mm-hmm, even if you know some sort of discount is fair.

And and if there's a disparate price, it's harder. So speaking of you know Communications and and educating What about companies where they were anticipating an IPO? Maybe not this year, but maybe the next couple of years. How do you talk to employees about their Equity about the 409a valuation? What would you suggest telling them? I mean it's hard right? I think. The thing from The General Counsel see that you all face and realizes when the 49a goes up. Everyone in the company thinks it's a good thing the value of the company's going up and reality. It's just it's just hurting them every time it does that. And so I think the communication now. which is the key is really looking at that as an opportunity to go to the employees and say look you missed a window previously when the 409a was lower.

They're actually going to go public solely to address this issue. And give the employees. the ability to sell into the IPO all the company's not Well, that's what the Wall Street Journal says is the rationale. Yeah employee the executives perhaps yeah and You know. when I read that from the investors lens, the the thing that was shocking to me was the concept that They're out on the Roadshow telling people to go buy the shares and they're saying all the Insiders want to sell the shares. Right? And and so unless and this is the part you're not in the room. And so I don't know the true story.

Yeah. What about Airbnb? What's your yeah, so I I wasn't.

I infected you. So talk a little bit. I guess I'll say the other thing I wouldn't do. And I take this because I know there's at least one GC in the room who did it. I wouldn't do company loan programs. I'd say you know if you look at Lyme and I'm sorry, right.

That you know, you should take loans from us in order to do this and Loans themselves have problems. They're tax inefficiencies, whether they're recourse or non-recourse and that if you go way back to 2001 that's a bunch of a bunch of my clients and friends who took loans and thought they were fine because they were non-recourse but then got hit with elimination and dentist income and had to file bankruptcy. And so oh I know a line You know those executives are on the hook for you know parts of those loans and it's below the equity value. I don't know the Vault story but D and good dno insurance the board. I mean it brings all those issues into play. There it is. Yeah. but I think I think some of that goes hand in hand where you really need to be thoughtful about.

I think optionality for the employees where they get to choose to maybe do a traditional tender produce structured Equity Finance or potentially take loans from the company.

Looking at it and saying okay if I had the benefit of all of the time. I mean one of the advantages for the gc's in the room is okay. Now I can I can prep a strategy around communication that's different. Like do you have advice for the group on? How you would think about that? Yeah, what you did well in the short period of time what you would have done if you definitely another day. Yes. Well, I mean one of the things you'll discover most likely is that the vast majority of employees don't even think about their Equity until they get close to IPO or to a liquidity event. And so if you're doing an IPO in a short time frame, that's a you really need to raise the level of understanding quickly and that was a situation at recursion. So we had three sets of trainings that we did and we offered them repeatedly like Ad nauseam, so we had a training that was an equity overview. we had one on the insider trading policy that also covered 10 b51 plans and then we were Foolish enough, I would say to all put an espp in place at the same time as the IPO. So we had a third training on the Employee Stock purchase plan and we made recordings of those trainings available. But we we didn't have the slide decks available separately because you do need the voice over particularly with respect to the espp because that's that's a prospectus. It can be treated as an offering of stock. So you need to make sure it's up to date and make sure you have all of the information being delivered at the same time.

It does depend on your employee base how large a company of course whether you're Global but also the company culture really makes a difference. Recursion we had a very transparent culture free IPO and we also have an endlessly curious and questioning and you know, very intelligent employee base.

The stock administrator is absolutely critical in this regard. I really recommend having your stock administrator hired pre-ipo hire someone with a ton of experience if possible.

Yeah, providing Financial or tax advice, but you can you can simplify. A lot of complicated things for them and then you can refer them off to wherever you firm, but the stock administrators portals or the employees go and they're looking at all their information. They also at least one who's in the room share works and I think Carter has it as well. All of that is is a great spot to be the repository for that information. So you make sure everyone's getting the same information. It's been blessed by legal. It's been blessed by around in tax. Yeah. Yeah and your broker will be really helpful from an education perspective. You know, when when you asked part of your question was what would I do differently? Yeah. Yeah, one of the things I think I would do differently is engage much more with the broker. We didn't have much time, you know to get things done. But ultimately we went with Fidelity which has amazing educational materials available on its website and they also offer personal advisors. We chose the option that everyone in the company could have their own advisor not just Executives and they that's a great resource for folks. I also would have hired our stock administrator sooner that individual was hired right around the same time. I was so three months into our four months of Ikea preparation",

    "text": ". It's a great spot. If you decide you're going to put out pieces and when we work with companies, we actually do because we feel like you got to educate them. Yeah, providing Financial or tax advice, but you can you can simplify. A lot of complicated things for them and then you can refer them off to wherever you firm, but the stock administrators portals or the employees go and they're looking at all their information. They also at least one who's in the room share works and I think Carter has it as well. All of that is is a great spot to be the repository for that information. So you make sure everyone's getting the same information. It's been blessed by legal. It's been blessed by around in tax. Yeah. Yeah and your broker will be really helpful from an education perspective. You know, when when you asked part of your question was what would I do differently? Yeah. Yeah, one of the things I think I would do differently is engage much more with the broker. We didn't have much time, you know to get things done. But ultimately we went with Fidelity which has amazing educational materials available on its website and they also offer personal advisors. We chose the option that everyone in the company could have their own advisor not just Executives and they that's a great resource for folks. I also would have hired our stock administrator sooner that individual was hired right around the same time. I was so three months into our four months of Ikea preparation. So we were both learning the company and you know learning the employee base at the same time and I also would wait longer to put an espp in place. You don't need to rush to do that that could have waited. For a year, I mean there was liquidity from the IPO. So there was no great need for it. But we're very ambitious company and I certainly were just looking at that as another perk. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was partly that Talent retention aspect. Yeah, so we have 15% discount with the espp that we put in place and While that was a big lift from an education standpoint, I think it was also really attractive for our employees. Yeah, and I hadn't thought about it until now but it would be interesting to see if that comes back into the you know, because you have you have Now options versus rsues people. Scared of the RSU plans and what's happening and the reasons why they're not going to go the option plan route. So I'll be interesting. Mm-hmm. So any other parting wisdom? Yeah, we only have a couple minutes left but I would say with respect to 10b51 plans. They're if you're at a smaller company, they're going to be a bit of a bear to handle and this is a place where the stock administrator can come in really helpful, too",

If you have a company with the level of transparency that I mentioned then you'll have way more people who need or arguably, you know should have 10 B, five one plans then at another type of company and it can scare your broker initially Fidelity told us we couldn't have that many people with tend to be five one plans because they were used to only section 16 officers and directors and the like having those plans and our company we had about 50 people with Tempe 51 plus which is a lot especially as you know, Ebola like all at one time. but The alternative if folks don't want to attend b51 plan is you put many people on a pre-clearance list. And so your stock administrator is going to be really helpful for you in kind of administering the pre-clearance list as well. You need a checklist for pre-clearance and you know, the admin can prepare much of that and then you as compliance officer essentially will be validating that they are pre-cleared to trade but it's a constant flow either of 10 B5 one plan review Drafting and review or of the pretty clearance. Thank you. Yeah. I think that's that's all we have time for.",

Um, and thank you everyone, uh, for joining via video. I don't really have to tell anyone to join on video, so that is great. Uh, this will be an interactive discussion. So, uh, we welcome all questions, comments, and, uh, feel free to unmute yourself during, um, with when any question or comment comes up. Um, but with that, we can go ahead and get started. I'll pass it over to our tech GC host for the evening, uh, Jolie Siegel, she is the CLO of C four Therapeutics Jolie. I'll pass it over to you. Thank you, Tara. So looking forward to this conversation tonight, and excited to have all of you guys joining us as well. My name is, as you said, is Jolie Siegel. I'm the Chief Legal Officer at C four Therapeutics, which is a company working on creating a new class of degrader medications for oncology and other, uh, therapeutic areas. And I've been with the company since June last year. I joined, uh, a couple weeks after a series B, and we immediately launched into an IPO, which closed, uh, 90 days after that. So in my first 120 days an IPO, that was interesting. Um, and since then we've gone on to get our first trial into the clinic and also do a follow on financing, uh, even before S3 eligibility. So it's been a busy and eventful year. On a personal note, on top of all that, I went on maternity leave at the end of May, so I'm finishing that up and go back to work next week. So, uh, lots of stuff going on, but did decide to tip my toes in the water with a board meeting this past week to just try and listen in 'cause I can't get enough of board dynamics. So that's sort of my background. Uh, we've got really great leadership from Fenwick with Alan and Kat on the line with us today, and they're gonna take us through a number of topics that we've thought about in terms of how to manage and get the most out of your board. Of course, as always, the best discussion come from comes from us asking questions and us sort of pushing through different scenarios and getting each other's input. So I would ask that folks, please chime in and let's make this as interactive as we possibly can. But I just wanna, you know, at the outset, thank the f team for their sponsorship, the event tonight. And I'll turn it over to Alan and Ka and let them introduce themselves. Yeah, say I'll go first. Uh, so thanks Julie. Uh, so my name is Kat Duncan. I'm a corporate partner at Fenwick and West. Um, I guess just a little bit about me first, and then I'll speak just really briefly about Fenwick",

So I'll give you my one challenge that I'm thinking about. You know, we've got a, um, ex a an engaged board of directors, but we don't have, uh, a lot of public company director experience on our board. So thinking about how to keep our board as well educated about what's topical and important today and what investors are expecting from directors is something that I'm always thinking about. And I'll turn over, I'm gonna go on my screen to Christine, who's first one up for me. Hi, everybody. Good evening. Um, happy to, to join this group. Um, so I just joined at Fire as its first general council, uh, three weeks ago. And we have our first, uh, board meeting coming up.

So, so we're privately held. We just had our, our parent company in Japan just kicked off our 100th year celebration or hundredth anniversary year. So, you know, we're well established and not seeking funding. And so I think I'm in a different space, or I'm handling different issues than many of you on the call.

Good evening everyone. My name's Fen Garcia. I'm A-C-L-O-C-C-O here at Southwest Key Programs. Uh, before I tell you about what Southwest Key does, I actually started off as a patent litigator, uh, which is the reason I joined Tech tc. I wanna stay close to my roots. Uh, did patent litigation for 10 years before joining a smog company here in Austin, uh, software slash IT company, and did a, was their GC and their, uh, VP of community resources for five, six years. Uh, then had an interesting opportunity to join the current organization where I'm at.

Uh, so it's a, it's a very unique organization and, uh, like I said, I joined Tech DC too 'cause I do still enjoy the technical aspects of, of law. Uh, one of the biggest issues I was brought on board for many reasons, but the biggest is kind of transformed the organization, uh, from the inside out. And one of the biggest issues that I've encountered is a board that is, uh, some legacy board members had causes some heartburn. And so trying to gently ask them to, Hey, you might wanna look somewhere else. And so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on how to transform a board, uh, when board members may be reticent to leave. All right. Who are you calling on next? Uh, Dustin Carlton. Hey, how's everybody doing? Uh, as he mentioned Dustin Carlton. I'm from Bellhop. I'm the VP of Legal and Compliance. I've been at the company for about three years. I'm in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Um, one of the reasons why I'm here at this, um, dinner seminar, um, is I don't actually have a corporate background. I was, uh, labor and employment, uh, prior to going in-house. And, um, so I'm always feeling like I'm ill-equipped, uh, to some extent, um, in the boardroom. So I think it's just helpful to surround myself as much education as possible on, on, uh, board matters. And one of the, well, there's a lot of issues, of course, running around, um, the company. But, um, you know, next year we'll be seeking some additional funding and I'm, I'm looking for additional ways just to better, um, equip the, the company going into our, our next fundraise",

    "text": ". Uh, one of the biggest issues I was brought on board for many reasons, but the biggest is kind of transformed the organization, uh, from the inside out. And one of the biggest issues that I've encountered is a board that is, uh, some legacy board members had causes some heartburn. And so trying to gently ask them to, Hey, you might wanna look somewhere else. And so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on how to transform a board, uh, when board members may be reticent to leave. All right. Who are you calling on next? Uh, Dustin Carlton. Hey, how's everybody doing? Uh, as he mentioned Dustin Carlton. I'm from Bellhop. I'm the VP of Legal and Compliance. I've been at the company for about three years. I'm in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Um, one of the reasons why I'm here at this, um, dinner seminar, um, is I don't actually have a corporate background. I was, uh, labor and employment, uh, prior to going in-house. And, um, so I'm always feeling like I'm ill-equipped, uh, to some extent, um, in the boardroom. So I think it's just helpful to surround myself as much education as possible on, on, uh, board matters. And one of the, well, there's a lot of issues, of course, running around, um, the company. But, um, you know, next year we'll be seeking some additional funding and I'm, I'm looking for additional ways just to better, um, equip the, the company going into our, our next fundraise. Um, so both with respect to the board and with respect to the just general company matters. And I'll call on, uh, Robin. No, I think you went, didn't you? No, I haven't said any Yet. Okay. I didn't have your name written down. I was like, wait. That's okay. That's alright. Um, I'm general counsel for a company called Token X and we tokenize sensitive data. So, um, structured and semi-structured. Um, it could be, um, bank account numbers, social security numbers, phone numbers, credit card numbers, um, started out, um, as a PCI compliance solution, but it's gotten broader than that. And in our company, we're a, you know, compared to you guys with 8,000 employees, we're a very small tech company, but right in the middle of due diligence for a round of funding. And so, um, like Dustin said, I don't have a heavy corporate governance background and exposure. I have a heavy tech contracting, et cetera, et cetera, liaison with technical people background, and our board, um, I suspect it's about to change with another round of funding. And, um, it's one of those situations where I haven't had any exposure to our board, but they know that, uh, our leadership team knows that I would like that. And so I'm kind of preparing for the day that all of a sudden they flip the switch on and say, oh, okay, well now how about you come over here. Our former general counsel is a shareholder and he is on the board. So, um, there's, and he's been there from day one, so, um, that's why I am not involved in the board at this time. And let's see. And who hasn't gone yet",

And who hasn't gone yet? Um, how about Renee Hunter? I was getting nervous I was gonna be the last picked, uh, it felt like I was back in kickball in elementary school. Uh, so Renee Hunter with Notarize, uh, we provide remote online notarization services, uh, in addition to identity proofing services, uh, as well as active software as a service for companies who wanna bring their own notaries on the platform and provide their own remote noter services. So, um, not as streamlined as initially thought. I joined notarized from the Quicken Loans family of companies. I have been part of every, uh, the passing of every single remote notarization law except for Virginia in 2011. Um, so since 2016 have been working with legislators and regulators and, uh, setting forth new legislation. That being said, I say that because that is where I, whether I should admit that's my area of expertise or not, that's my area of expertise. Um, working with a board, even though I was general counsel at my past company, we were privately held and it was a very different scenario at the time. So wanting to learn more about how to work better with the board, and quite honestly, how do you kick some, some of the extra observers and like visitors off the board when they just keep showing up to the meeting and do it politely. Like, if you only have one observer seat, you should only bring one person, not three. So I love to hear how some of you have handled that in the past, and maybe it's just as blunt as you can't all come",

I'm General Counsel Plaid. We're, uh, a financial services, um, technology infrastructure company. And, um, I'm interested in many of the topics people have raised. Um, I'd say probably one of the things I'm thinking about is kind of transitioning from a mainly investor, um, populated board to one that's, um, got independent, uh, directors and sort of the kind of reporting and expectations to, to kind of get the board to where they will, you know, they should be if we were a public company. But, um, many of these topics are very interesting, so thank you. Oh, I'm supposed to pick someone. Um, let's see. Diana, Diane, did you hear Her? Diana, that's me, yes. Hi everyone. I'm, I'm Diane ui. I'm general counsel of ezCater. ezCater is an online marketplace for ordering corporate catering. We're a private VC-backed company. Uh, board currently consists of eight members, a couple of founders, couple of independents and four investors as well as, uh, a couple of board observers where potentially, um, going public in a year or two.

We are sort of an old dumb company, uh, but trying to heavily invest in technology and, uh, sort of follow the adage, right? You are either a tech company, you are either turning into a tech company or being replaced by a tech company. So we are trying to not be replaced and hopefully turn into a tech company. Um, like I said, we've been a public company. We've actually been a public company for, um, I wanna say about 40 years. But, but therein lies a little bit of the rub. Um, our company has only had two CEOs before the current CEO and both of those CEOs were sort of the, one was the founder owner, the other was his son. So the board members sort of, I think if you look at, um, look at a lot of, you know, literature on boards, you know, um, and if you sort of did the, the cature of old school board, that would be our board.

Um, I have to say that in listening to people's comments on boards, I think one thing that, um, I was reminded of that I have questions about is this is the earliest stage company I've ever been with. Um, I've been with, you know, much, I've been with public companies in earlier phases of my career where I have some corporate experience, um, with disclosures and filings as well as, you know, some exposure to the board, but not a ton because I was not the general counsel at that time. So I've never been the general counsel, um, dealing with a public company board. So, um, I guess one of the things I, I wonder about is in doing our latest round, um, I learned that the choice of the investors was related to, um, the current, uh, board and CEO's kind of thoughts on who might be best as a director. Um, we were oversubscribed as in many, um, digital health situations. And I think, um, as happens as commonly happens, you know, the choosing the choice of which investors can sometimes be connected to what their presence on the board might mean. And so I'm interested in hearing from both Fenwick and colleagues as to what their experience has been in that arena",

    "text": ". Um, and, um, I have to say that in listening to everyone's comments on their board questions, we are Series D by the way, we just closed our Series D this summer. Um, I have to say that in listening to people's comments on boards, I think one thing that, um, I was reminded of that I have questions about is this is the earliest stage company I've ever been with. Um, I've been with, you know, much, I've been with public companies in earlier phases of my career where I have some corporate experience, um, with disclosures and filings as well as, you know, some exposure to the board, but not a ton because I was not the general counsel at that time. So I've never been the general counsel, um, dealing with a public company board. So, um, I guess one of the things I, I wonder about is in doing our latest round, um, I learned that the choice of the investors was related to, um, the current, uh, board and CEO's kind of thoughts on who might be best as a director. Um, we were oversubscribed as in many, um, digital health situations. And I think, um, as happens as commonly happens, you know, the choosing the choice of which investors can sometimes be connected to what their presence on the board might mean. And so I'm interested in hearing from both Fenwick and colleagues as to what their experience has been in that arena. As well as, um, managing the board from a general counsel perspective, particularly if you come in, um, at any time, say post series A and there have already been board, you know, directors there for a while, have a relationship with the CEO and what that means for the GC in terms of influence with the board and what kind of independent relationship one can have with the board when the, the CEO, you know, is, is in charge and, and has had a longer relationship with those directors. So interested in hearing a bit about that as well. Thanks, Sarah. And then Joanna, I think we have, we have you on our list. Yes. Last but not least, Go next. Sorry. I'm the, uh, um, uh, CLO and SVP of NEO Systems, and we provide back office, um, solutions for government contractors, um, hosting cybersecurity, um, managed cybersecurity accounting services, um, human capital management, um, and financial planning and analysis, um, uh, for, for not just government contractors, but highly regulated, um, industries such as nonprofits and so forth. Um, and the challenge we're currently facing is we were just, we are recently acquired by, um, a private equity firm. And so our whole board has been replaced except for the founders. They remain on, but we have the investors on the board, um, now as well. And so this is a very timely, uh, session, uh, for, for our company. Awesome. Thank you. And do we have, have we done introductions for everyone? Craig, did we get you? No, you didn't. Sorry, I had to jump off. Uh, hi everyone. Craig Siegel. Uh, I am, uh, CLO at, uh, Hootsuite. Uh, I'm located in Toronto",

Uh, I'm located in Toronto. Uh, Hootsuite is, uh, a social media management platform, so assists, uh, businesses with, uh, social marketing, social commerce, uh, 1200 employees. Um, our board is made up of, uh, essentially, uh, founder and, and, uh, investor, uh, nominees. Uh, we are looking at a, a bunch of different opportunities that, uh, could impact the, uh, the makeup of the board, essentially potentially looking to move to more of an independent board. Uh, about a year, year and a half ago, we moved from a founder, CEO, uh, who, uh, interest was, uh, not, uh, not that much into, uh, heavy governance. And we've moved into a, uh, essentially a professional CEO where governance is absolutely at the forefront. So it's a bit of a continuum in terms of, uh, strengthening our, uh, governance program. So, uh, looking forward to the conversation. Awesome. Well really appreciate everybody giving some context and background on where they are. I'll jump in with the first question, but folks, please plan to jump in and help me out 'cause no one wants to just hear my questions. Uh, one of the things that, that resonated with me in listening to everybody and their questions tonight is about the evolving role of a board of directors over the lifecycle of a company. If I think about my CEO, he talks about the board having a responsibility to deliver foresight, oversight, and insight. And, you know, different people can deliver different parts of that, perhaps. Certainly the role of the board changes when you're talking about an early stage startup company all the way through a public company. And so, Kat and Ellen, I'm curious as to how would you recommend folks like us think about the board and its role and how to interact with them most effectively based on those different stages of life? Yeah, I'll jump in",

Yeah, I'll jump in. I mean, I, I think you start out as a, a newly formed company with a founder, two founders, they're on the board, and, and there's a first step which involves some level of giving up control, right? And that's a, that's a big moment. You take money from someone outside, um, your board immediately changes. It's not just your company anymore. You've gotta, um, even if it, even if they don't have control of the board, most things are done by consensus at that level. And you need to bring someone along with you, you need to report to them. So board meetings become professionalized. You're, um, you're preparing materials in advance, you're taking criticism and input. Um, I think some people alluded to the importance of who you recruit. And Julie, I liked your, your, um, I'm not sure I can repeat it, your foresight, oversight, and insight. Was it, um, that that's where I think foresight and insight are most important at that stage. Perhaps, um, you know, you a board member that is also an investor that can come in and has, has been there with other companies and can see, you know, what the, what the dials are for your company to help take it to the next level to prepare it for its next fundraising round to go to market, um, to, to penetrate customer bases that you haven't before. Um, I think the board at that stage is, is doing a lot more, um, senior experience, business advice and strategy advice than they are governance and oversight",

You know, the governance and oversight happens from your, your, your contractual documents, your, um, the rules and, and the fact that there's no more money coming if, if you don't do, do your job right and please your investors along the way. Um, oftentimes at that stage, a board will have a, a, an empty seat for an independent director. You know, I often see this kind of board of five, two founders, two um, two investors, and a fifth player to be named later that's gonna be an independent director. You know, I think that that independent director can be worth their weight in gold if they are really a contributor. So, um, companies often wait a long time to find them. You gotta pay them usually, um, if you want 'em to, to do good work. Um, if you move too quickly and get the wrong person, I think you can, you can pay for something that doesn't add value or worse.

Um, so I think searching for, for someone at that stage to fill that role, um, can be important. Your board will only grow from there. So I heard a couple of you talk about, you know, how do I, how do I get rid of board members? Um, it's hard, right? So I do think caution as you grow your board is important. 'cause it's kind of a one way ratchet in a way. Um, you know, there comes a time often when those two founder seats are too many and the boardroom's getting crowded, and maybe that second founder is, you know, is likely is not. The CEO is a, an exec that reports to the CEO and it may be less appropriate at some stage for that person to be in all of the board discussions. Um, and, you know, there comes a time when that discussion needs to happen of we're gonna go to a, a board with one, you know, common seat, one founder seed. And you know, that's where two partners that have gone into business together, um, and or, you know, that independent director that I talked about in the previous chapter that you've recruited can have that conversation with the person about stepping back and being able to focus on, um, the management.

Um, I think you're doing it wrong if you're treating your board meeting as theater, uh, whether for the rest of your management team or for, you know, um, others that come along with your investors, um, you know, for the board to have an effective discussion for them to disagree with one another, um, to disagree with management and provide feedback, um, you not, not conflict, I'm not saying that in a negative way, but to have a healthy exchange and a dialogue that hopefully leads to a better answer. I think a more intimate environment is important. And so I would be very cautious about expanding the boardroom too much.

Um, and, and then I think you gotta spend a lot more time trying to demonstrate the value of it and the importance of it. And, you know, I, I find it hard. I know you all find it hard because I think a lot of the times you've got to, you've gotta go to sort of horror stories. And this is what happens when things go badly and don't let this be you. And, you know, I never like to have to persuade that way because I think it's easy for people to, you know, distance themselves from that and believe it's not gonna be them. But, you know, I've seen the movie, I've seen how it ends that way. It ends that way for many companies. Um, you know, and one way or another turning negative. And, and you want to have had the right governance along the way to, before you get to that point. So one of the other questions that we got at the outset was sort of around how to manage getting somebody off the board. And, and I know Alan and Kat, you've guys got some war stories around this.

    "text": ". So if there's a, you know, a chairman, chair, chair person, um, that is senior and seasoned and cares about these things, that's great, right? You can go to them, you can talk to them about how do we work together to, to do this. If you're fighting, you know, a board that wants to cut to the chase and doesn't wanna work on these things and, you know, maybe A-A-C-E-O or a management team that isn't as focused on it, that can be a hard road to hoe. Um, and, and then I think you gotta spend a lot more time trying to demonstrate the value of it and the importance of it. And, you know, I, I find it hard. I know you all find it hard because I think a lot of the times you've got to, you've gotta go to sort of horror stories. And this is what happens when things go badly and don't let this be you. And, you know, I never like to have to persuade that way because I think it's easy for people to, you know, distance themselves from that and believe it's not gonna be them. But, you know, I've seen the movie, I've seen how it ends that way. It ends that way for many companies. Um, you know, and one way or another turning negative. And, and you want to have had the right governance along the way to, before you get to that point. So one of the other questions that we got at the outset was sort of around how to manage getting somebody off the board. And, and I know Alan and Kat, you've guys got some war stories around this. Um, before I, I direct you guys to sort of jump into the topic. One thing I'll, I'll share just for again, entertainment value, you know, we had a director at one of my prior employee employers who, um, was known to show up and then promptly fall asleep at the meeting, had been an employee of the company and a prior executive was on as our chairman, um, but often was the least useful person in the room. And sort of no way to move that person out with any, you know, ease, especially in the context of it being a public company where, you know, that would be very visible. And so I'm curious as to how you think about, right, if you're in the private company stage and you're going for a next round of financing, that's often an inflection point where you can sort of group together with some directors and talk about who should stay and who should go. But are there other strategies that you would recommend for thinking through and, and, and how do you see the GCs role in that? Yeah, I, you know, I've seen it, um, I've seen it go poorly and I've seen it go well. I think to your, uh, illusion, Julie, about the private company context. One of the harder situations is when it's a VC from a prior round that has a contractual right to that board seat. And you've, you've not only gotta ask the the person to step down, um, but you've gotta ask the VC to, to give up their right. There is a middle ground there that I see sort of work, which is to allow them to keep their contractual right and appoint, you know, an independent to their seat that you agree on",

There is a middle ground there that I see sort of work, which is to allow them to keep their contractual right and appoint, you know, an independent to their seat that you agree on. I don't love that solution. 'cause I think it, it compromises that incoming director's ability to truly feel independent if they are, you know, at the, at the behest of contractually, at the behest of a, of a particular investor. Um, even if that investor is saying, I'm not gonna exercise that, right? But that can be a bridge too, right? That can be a way to allow the VC to save face with their peers and not having to give up their rights while getting the person that you want in the door. And, you know, maybe nine months down the road that changes. Um, I do think that there's a, you know, a hard conversation that has to be had there. And usually it's the CEO that's, that's having it. Um, it's another situation where I think having an ally on the board, you know, um, can, can be valuable because it, it's personal and, and at one level you're telling, um, that director that you want off for whatever reason, that you don't find their contributions as valuable as the others. And that may be who their fund is and what connections they have. That may be their actual level of participation and engagement. Um, you know, I guess it's easier if they are openly disengaged or not attending or those sorts of things, but it's often more subtle than that. And so, you know, the, the worst situations I've seen that discussion led to a, you know, a conflict between the CEO and the director asked to leave that spilled out into, you know, the boardroom and was a public conflict and, and people were left feeling, uh, feeling badly about it.

I, I think the best situations I've seen, actually, it's a public company context, but I'm not sure it doesn't translate, were situations where there was a chair who himself ultimately needed to step aside in favor of new blood and, uh, open the dialogue, you know, a quarter in advance with the board about what the objectives are and how, you know, we've got a board that is here and we want to get it to here for these reasons. Whether it's diversity, bringing in more independence, um, bringing in more audit committee expertise, bringing in more operational skill sets to mentor the CEO. Um, we need to achieve all those objectives. And, you know, that's gonna involve some transitioning of board members. I, I'd like to hear from each of you what your, you know, continued interest level is in participating, but I'm gonna be talking to you about that dialogue and how we, how we order it. And I, I think trying to get people focused on why you're doing this in a way that is not personal to them and what, why it's good for the company is good table setting and just framing it and then building a plan where the succession that needs to happen is staged over time. So, you know, maybe one seed is surrendered every year, and that's known in advance. You know, we're gonna move out our series A director next year, and we're gonna replace them with, um, an independent diverse board member. And then in the second year, as we're a year away from IPO, we're gonna move out our series B board member and we're gonna replace 'em with an audit committee chair",

Yeah, I would, I would just reiterate that the, um, for a lot of you, you are later stage private companies and, uh, the preparation for going public needs to happen far earlier than an org meeting. Um, getting, getting a public company ready board needs to happen, you know, at least sometimes like 18 months, two years before you're gonna go out. Um, in particular, just because these days it's not just finding an audit committee financial expert and finding folks who can read financial statements. Um, if any of you have companies that are headquartered in California, you have to comply with the, you know, the California laws, uh, with respect to having, you know, women being on your board and underrepresented minorities on your board. Um, and for anyone who is planning to list on nasdaq, NASDAQ just came out with their rules, right? So your board, uh, within a year of listing would have to have a, a woman and an underrepresented minority, uh, on the board.

So I think to Alan's point, like coming up with a strategy far earlier than actually being public about what is my board, you know, here to do and actually putting together like a rubric for what I want out of it, and, you know, coming up with actual competency matrices and who's checking kind of, uh, you know, what boxes, and it's not just from a, you know, this is a, a diverse candidate, but you know, someone who has operational background, someone who has experience scaling my particular type of business, um, you know, someone who has experience on doing, you know, extensive m and a, if that's a big part of your, your strategy, um, making sure that you're kind of filling those gaps and to Alan's point, planning how you're gonna fill those and starting a conversation early with, uh, you know, with your existing board members about how we're gonna reach those goals and transition to it. So it's a smooth glide into becoming a public company as opposed to this being like a slap dash rush, right? Like at an org meeting where you're frantically competing for candidates because, um, as I'm sure many of you are aware right now that the market for finding, um, independent board members, let alone people who can, uh, you know, folks who are women, folks who are underrepresented minorities, it is, it's very, very competitive right now.

So starting the dialogue a lot earlier than you'd think can be actually a mechanism for you to help maneuver, uh, maneuver your board in the direction of going more independent, um, uh, you know, for the, for the long term. Can I, can I push on that one for a second? I think that probably depends on what, um, what your vertical is, what your market is. I think you, you raised some really good points. I mean, we're going public very shortly. We have a board that is, uh, five of the nine are not white men, I put it that way. Mm-hmm. That way.

And then I don't know if you have to wait till, till you have your IPO kickoff meeting, but sometimes sooner than that, sometime closer to that, you know, nine months out when you're potentially even hiring your public company, CFO when you're, you know, those types of things. Now it's really getting into going, I think is is an easier time to make those transitions. That's my thoughts. Yeah, I think that's all true, Diane. I think a lot, a lot in a lot of cases it depends, right? There's sort of two themes going on in the world as I see it. There's one that's been there a little longer, which is companies we're taking longer and longer to go public and they were raising more and more money as private companies. And so you have these, you know, uh, unicorns, right? That, um, are raising larger and larger rounds on bigger and bigger valuations and adding more VCs to the mix.

This is what we want our board to look like, have conversations, start having conversations with potential board members and saying, look, if we're getting closer, you know, we'd really be interested in you. And then I don't know if you have to wait till, till you have your IPO kickoff meeting, but sometimes sooner than that, sometime closer to that, you know, nine months out when you're potentially even hiring your public company, CFO when you're, you know, those types of things. Now it's really getting into going, I think is is an easier time to make those transitions. That's my thoughts. Yeah, I think that's all true, Diane. I think a lot, a lot in a lot of cases it depends, right? There's sort of two themes going on in the world as I see it. There's one that's been there a little longer, which is companies we're taking longer and longer to go public and they were raising more and more money as private companies. And so you have these, you know, uh, unicorns, right? That, um, are raising larger and larger rounds on bigger and bigger valuations and adding more VCs to the mix. They can't just keep accumulating, you know, board members until they're 14 or 15, right? In that context, when you're asking your early stage investors that, you know, their strategy is not to keep up with growth stage investors, they don't have the, the balance sheets to, to do their pro rata share of those deals, you start to have it made more sense and be easier to, you know, replace an early one with a later one maybe. So that's, that may be a, a, a situation where you would find the contractual give up a little easier. The the other wave though is the SPAC wave, you know, and we have companies going public much earlier than they used to before. They've spent a long time planning, preparing, developing all the infrastructure, you know, working on, you know, um, SOX compliance. And I, I think it's gonna be interesting to see, um, you know, how that all turns out. Uh, it is gonna be a bit of an experiment and there are companies that have a very high level of sophistication and development at the time that they do it. And I, I trust that's all of you that are doing your SPACs right now. There are some that I've seen that it's, it's less so, and it's gonna be a bigger leap of faith for them to get there. And, and they, they wind up with a very short period of time in order to build all the infrastructure that you need to be a public company. I, I think where you don't want to be is to find yourself public and only focused on building your business. When you're in a fishbowl. The, the regulators, the investors, institutional investors are looking at you, uh, as a public company",

Hey, Alan and Kat, I have one question. Kat. You mentioned, you know, these, uh, board qualification and competency reviews, you know, qualification tables that public companies put out in proxies. Um, here's sort of looking for some practical guidance from anybody in this group. You send out, you know, a competency matrix, qualification matrix to the board, and people will sort of cross out as their competencies, all sorts of boxes, right? Um, They'll say they're excellent at everything except at anything that gets 'em stuck on the audit committee. Oh, there you, there you go. Right? Look, someone who's doing middle market deals is not gonna be the right person for somebody who's a public company looking for transformational deals, right? Someone who has done a lot of, and you all should not take anything about our board as a result of this, this, these comments, but just think about it, right? Someone who's dealt with construction industry, all of his or her life is not going to be the person who's going to be able to say, yeah, pay 10 times the revenue of this tech company because here's why it makes sense or doesn't, right? Any thoughts, practical pointers on how you interact with those kinds of situations? In my mind, right? Where I'm trying to lead this is create a pathway of the two, three years down the road where people who are not suited for those seats eventually reach the conclusion that, Hey, I've had a great run.

So, you know, I, I think one, let's be honest, most of the time it is A-A-C-E-O or a founder that is building, you know, their board, particularly at these stages. And the relationship that he or she has with, um, those members that have been recruited is important to this.

I think, um, you know, I think the, the people tasked with recruiting the board or the ones that have to make their own assessment of that and about what the company needs, oftentimes that's a CEO. But one thing that's occurred to me in this conversation that um, uh, I I think is an interesting thought is, is there value in, in, in paneling a nominating corporate governance committee at an earlier stage? It's not something that's required until you're a public company. I tend to not be a fan of, I certainly don't want people building bureaucracy or building committees and structure that you're not going to use.

You know, it's interesting. We did a, an exercise at one of my companies where we did that competency chart and we asked directors to fill it out and we debated having the nominating corporate governance committee fill it out for the whole board, and ultimately we're pushed to have each director self-report, which was really an interesting lesson in who's an easy grader and who's a hard grader. Um, ultimately though, we used that as an exercise to try to identify a phenotype for a candidate search that we wanted to kick off that management was pushing for an additional director and wanted to get to an alignment on a profile. You know, it can be a helpful way to try to do it. And you can design that chart, right? You don't have to take a generic chart that you find from somebody. You can design the chart to match what you think is important in the skillset.

Who do we have? So our company was recently acquired by a private equity firm and they required the entire executive team to undergo disc assessment, um, tests. And we all thought that was kind of silly. Um, but once we got the results we were after, we were all horrified at our own results. We were encouraged to share them with each other and, and also we're trying to hire a new CFO. Um, and they were required to take the DISC assessment and some people were eliminated immediately because they didn't indicate the traits that were desirable for the particular role, you know, but it also shows there, there's lots of stuff like how to communicate with people and so forth, but you can also identify, do these people have the traits that are associated with the role of a board member that you are desiring? It's really interesting. I can do it. We just did a disc for our executive team last week. I did it for my legal team in July because I think it's a really great exercise to go through. I've done it, did it years ago at TripAdvisor a number of times. Um, we had the discussion about as we add board members in the future, would we do that? I think it's a useful tool. I would add, and, and this is kind of coming from our moderator, that like, don't use this as a hiring tool. Like, I think it's a dangerous thing.

I don't think anyone at any company feels like they get it perfectly right. But I'm curious as to what you think are some best practices because for us, you know, I, I struggle with the fact that I'm not confident that a lot of folks do all the pre-reading, which is a really frustrating feeling, but a reality. And at the same time, you know, you don't wanna be reading slides and it's really disheartening to the leadership team if you feel like you put all this work into the materials and then you're sort of reading them to the, to the board members. Yeah, I I think you're right about, um, no one ever getting that right. I do a lot of board self-evaluations and I think it's commonly a topic from one end to the other for a complaint. Um, I do most commonly hear directors asking for more strategic discussion, more focused opportunity for dialogue and less reading of slides. And that's a common, um, common refrain I see in the chat folks saying, I, I'm not, I'm skeptical that people do the pre-read. I think you gotta count on 'em to do the pre-read.

They're not buried on page 80 that, you know, our, our CAC is going down or are we're having a churn problem or, you know, whatever it might be. Um, we're gonna call that to your attention so you see it. And by the way, these are the three questions that I want us to discuss and focus on at this board meeting. And so, you know, having that front and center, like the first page of the board package so that people can, um, can focus in on what the key data is they need to pick up and then go deeper and they can start thinking in advance about what the questions are. Um, and then just from the, the governance perspective, this is a little more boring than that topic, but, um, preor organizing, what is the approval agenda both from, you know, a list of items that need to be approved, but also actually drafting the resolutions in advance, you know, where there are blanks or decisions that need to be made, you know, leaving that decision tree. And clearly, I, I find these situations in board meetings where that isn't done from time to time.

Um, we're gonna call that to your attention so you see it. And by the way, these are the three questions that I want us to discuss and focus on at this board meeting. And so, you know, having that front and center, like the first page of the board package so that people can, um, can focus in on what the key data is they need to pick up and then go deeper and they can start thinking in advance about what the questions are. Um, and then just from the, the governance perspective, this is a little more boring than that topic, but, um, preor organizing, what is the approval agenda both from, you know, a list of items that need to be approved, but also actually drafting the resolutions in advance, you know, where there are blanks or decisions that need to be made, you know, leaving that decision tree. And clearly, I, I find these situations in board meetings where that isn't done from time to time. You come away as, as council trying to draft minutes and it's not totally clear that everybody did agree on the same thing. Um, getting it in front of them so that they're actually looking at a concrete, you know, resolution or program that they're passing and, and making sure that's written down I think can be valuable. And so I, I like to do a meeting with, um, inhouse council a week before a board meeting. We work together on going through the agenda items, getting the resolutions drafted, running to ground any open issues or problems, um, so that that's all prepackaged and ready to go and organized by the time the board package comes along. Yeah, I would, uh, so I think, uh, one point I think Meredith put in the chat was like the, uh, I think that's the Amazon style, right? Like Amazon starts every single meeting with like the first whatever, 10 or 15 minutes or for people to like literally sit quietly and read. Um, I, I kind of side a little bit with Alan in the sense of like, you know, you don't often have, you know, boards aren't meeting that frequently. Uh, it's usually four to six meetings a year. Um, and the expectation is that they would, um, that they would hopefully be doing a pre-read. But I think in order to ensure and set yourself up for success or to, um, you know, one is, uh, to I think Jolie's point, like putting together like an executive summary that's like pretty, you know, tight that's gonna hit on all of the major points is gonna be important",

So if someone is short on time, they at least have a single source that is gonna have all of the material points that need to be conveyed to the board and potentially teed up for discussion in, in an executive summary. Um, followed up by, you know, like the more robust kind of PowerPoint that's gonna have all of the, you know, let's dive into the details. And then there's a completely separate much, much, much shorter deck that will just guide the discussion. Uh, and the, the talking points for the actual meeting itself, those shouldn't be the same deck. They need to be separate decks, which is the deep dive and then the actual presentation deck. Um, and then there's also just some nuts and bolts things too. Like I know a lot of folks are moving to actual board, um, platforms. So meaning making sure that your board members actually know how to access and use the platform, um, or if you're, you know, using Google Docs or whatever it is, just making sure that folks technologically can get a hold of the docs. That's, I think a kind of a bit of a complaint that I've seen from, from board members that they, you know, quote, I didn't know how to download it or I didn't know how to get the materials. It's a, it's a low bar thing, but um, just something that you should, you should be checking on. Um, and again, like also just making sure that you get the materials out with sufficient advanced notice",

Um, and again, like also just making sure that you get the materials out with sufficient advanced notice. Um, you know, I definitely think for our, our smaller private companies, you know, board materials are often going out only like less than 24 hours in advance. Sometimes it's quite a bit of a scramble, but I think the expectation in particular as you, as you grow as a company is those materials need to be going out with, you know, needs to be more time. Um, so the board actually has time to, you know, review and digest it, not just 24 hours or 36 hours notice, um, for the materials. And by the way, this is all more important in Zoom land because, um, you know, you don't, you have people's attention for less time or you should, your meetings should probably be sorter and more focused while, you know, we're in these virtual worlds. Um, 'cause people get fatigued more, more quickly and it's harder to, um, have the, the, the triggers that come from, um, being able to lay eyes on people in person and and respond to conversation and, and human interaction. So I think focusing in the meeting on the key things that need to be taken away is, is ever more important in this world. But like there was a question there that I talked over, who is Meredith? Um, I, I just had a question about board portals, you know, like board document portals and like why or if people think that's really a valuable thing or not. I mean I know that many companies use them and once you get a lot of communications it's probably useful just 'cause it's all in one place. But I'm just curious if anyone has a view about that.

Yeah, so Meredith, I I have a couple thoughts. I mean they're, in terms of which one to use, I think they're a bit fungible, but I actually like them for two particular reasons. One is the security of the information. So the ability to keep your important information behind some sort of secure system, not just email appeals to me, but I also think it's really valuable for folks in our seat in particular, right? It gives me a role where I get to step in and say, you know, we'll manage the portal, we'll manage the distribution material and everything goes to the board through that portal. It gives me a lot of, um, centralization of how information flows out and puts me in the middle of it, which I think is good from a governance perspective and also an information flow perspective. 'cause I know what's gonna be going in front of the board. So I, I think selfishly I like it for both those reasons. I don't know if other folks have different views. You, one thing you may wanna consider is there's some literature out there in recent case law, certainly in Delaware on when some of these things become discoverable and, uh, how to manage the litigation holes and things like that. Just making sure that, you know, the, the, the line between, uh, uh, what information should remain privileged is actually remaining privileged and all. And I think doing that from uh, portals is much easier than using their own personal emails or God forbid you actually provide them a company email address and, and then, you know, have to deal with that",

Yeah, I I, I think actually that's a, that's a important, like, it seems like a small point, but I, I think there was recent case law that came out of where when you're emailing your board and they're using like not, you know, company email addresses, it's gonna jeopardize privilege. And so I think that's why using potentially a a, a system, like I saw many people mention Diligent, that's what a lot of my clients have used as well. Um, you know, using a system or if you're not gonna use the system actually creating like an alias for your board, you know, like if it's board at, um, you know, your company name.com or something like that, uh, to, to keep your privilege tight, um, and to make sure you don't have any accidental leakage. I ask a, We think as much that that's privileged from in a, in a board deck. Sorry, there Certain, there could be, we've certainly had things where we had derivative lawsuits or other things like that where we were getting advice or sharing advice. We would typically not put it in the slides. That's what I was say. I don't put anything I have like legal update is what I put in this slide. No, we've done that Diane, but we've also had to do resolutions in some cases and at least those could theoretically have something in it. Y yeah, no, or if you're just emailing out the materials, people then just start replying on the thread, right? And they just start saying things and you can't control necessarily what people reply back to you, right? So I think that's part of the concern.

Yeah, I have a, well I have a question sort of like, piggybacking on all of this, which is like, and I think it's uh, Diane, it's sort of like what, touching on what you just said, but like when you do need to communicate those sensitive, like let's call 'em low lights, um, of the quarter or you know, whatever period to the board of directors, like how do people think about like, navigating that? Is it something that we should be documenting in a board deck board? Is it something that we should just be talking about with like the audit committee? Just what are, what's the, what are the thoughts on that? What else wanna go? And Karen, if you, if you're talking about, you know, the data of, you know, the results for the quarter, those, those are facts, right? Those are what they are. If you're talking about, I Mean I'm, I'm talking about like just issues like yeah, Oh we Had a, we had a quality issue like this past quarter and like here's the download of it. Yeah, I mean, I'm a big believer in thinking really strategically about what should be in writing and what should not be in writing to Diane's point. I, you know, I think there are a lot of times where you might put, you know, a, a topic for discussion but not put the detail or you might put, you know, just so you just lead that to an exec session and bring it up verbally if that makes the most sense.

So you can send materials and you can send an email, but have it go through a secure mechanism. So the content of the email doesn't even show up on their phone. They have to log in to see the email. Just something else to think about. Julie, has that been a challenge?

Yeah, and I certainly push hard that everything should go through the portal and I don't win a hundred percent of the time.

I'm like, yeah, but it's not public yet. And I, I tend to fall back to Meredith's point about let's have the directors have one stop shopping for all of our content in one place.

You can leverage that argument sometimes. Data security is a big one I use to try and push for it. And I, and I do think the one-stop shopping makes it easier for directors.

Yeah, I I often see friction in the adoption process directors who are not that tech savvy complaining about it or who just wanna work a certain way. And, you know, I think there's that initial adoption curve that can, can be painful and it does generate complaints, but it, it has value and benefits to the company if you can get people over the hump and working that way. The other place that comes up a lot is airplanes. Um, you know, I, I want to be able to get on the plane to fly to the board meeting and I wanna, you know, be able to have access to it in paper so I can read it or, you know, on my download from my iPad or something not logging into a portal. And to the extent it's pushing people to that, that's one Gotcha. That I think we haven't seen the end of yet is airplane, um, airplane internet. Um, you know, I am sure you've seen some of the studies and news stories with reporters who've managed to pull just crazy things off of the wifi that are floating around the cabin. And so, I mean, really your directors should not be on an internet reading anything confidential on the plane. 'cause it's, it's not secure. Um, I had a crazy situation where a director FaceTimed into a board meeting from an airplane, um, that bad behavior in multiple ways, but, uh, another one to watch out for. So I was gonna ask a much more rudimentary question than the stuff you guys are all talking about. Okay",

Um, you know, I, I want to be able to get on the plane to fly to the board meeting and I wanna, you know, be able to have access to it in paper so I can read it or, you know, on my download from my iPad or something not logging into a portal. And to the extent it's pushing people to that, that's one Gotcha. That I think we haven't seen the end of yet is airplane, um, airplane internet. Um, you know, I am sure you've seen some of the studies and news stories with reporters who've managed to pull just crazy things off of the wifi that are floating around the cabin. And so, I mean, really your directors should not be on an internet reading anything confidential on the plane. 'cause it's, it's not secure. Um, I had a crazy situation where a director FaceTimed into a board meeting from an airplane, um, that bad behavior in multiple ways, but, uh, another one to watch out for. So I was gonna ask a much more rudimentary question than the stuff you guys are all talking about. Okay. Um, so when I came into the company, there was no delegation of authority. There was no, like, there was just like, it was very, you know, early stage willy-nilly decision making. And I slowly sort of implemented what I would call like pretty minor controls, levels of controls. Like what's, where is there a playbook somewhere that I should be following to get from here to there? You know, I mean, I've looked on, you know, I've looked at, do I remember Rachel, that you're and all The tech GC sources, and honestly, it's hard to stomach paying a lawyer hundreds of dollars an hour to tell you what's like, mostly common sense stuff, right? But just figuring out how to get from here to there is a tough thing. Like you all are talking about portals for board members. Well, all of our board members are, you know, either the, the, the two co-founders or the investors, right? And those seats are just, are just appointed by those people. And so they're gonna get data daily communications from us. I can't control any of that, right? So we're in a really different place. And I, I've talked to a bunch of lawyers, lawyers that do other work for us, you know, at, at big law firms, what I would call fancy schmancy law firms. And their advice isn't particularly helpful because they're not used to dealing with a company of my size, um, or a stage. So what's the, you know, what's the playbook in, in to get from here to there, right",

Um, if I remember right Rachel, you have a, an acquirer who's coming in and they're gonna be establishing their own controls and procedures so that that may happen faster than, um, my, my guess is that there's gonna be a pretty clear, you know, edict from corporate about, you know, what the rules are now.

I, um, just wanna reiterate thank you everyone for joining. Um, I put this code for CLE in the chat. I'll also be following a post event. There are a couple articles that were shared, so we'll include those as well. Uh, but thank you to Jolie for being our tech GC host for the evening, and thank you to Alan and Kat from Fenwick for sponsoring this event. Um, their contact information will also be included in the post event email. Um, and this was a great conversation. Hopefully you all, uh, found it very valuable and, um, thanks for your time tonight. Thanks everyone. Thanks everyone. Enjoyed meeting with you.",

Um, our panel today will focus on the art of professionalism, navigating ethical conduct in legal practice. We have a really great set of speakers here for you today, and I'm really pleased to welcome Katherine Kirkpatrick, chief Legal Officer at SIBO Digital. We have Amelia Hinky, vice President of Legal affairs@olver.com Inc. And our moderator today is Jasmine Singh, general counsel at Binti on behalf of Law Trades. A big thank you for our to our sponsor today, for today's webinar, or for today's virtual Panel Law Trades for making this event possible. And as usual, if you have any questions, please do make sure that you submit them using the q and a tool in Zoom rather than the chat box. We will be taking the questions throughout the presentation as the questions are relevant to the information presented. If there are any questions that go unanswered, um, during the presentation today, we will make sure that they're answered afterwards. Please make sure, um, to remember that Chatham House rules apply to, uh, today with regard to the information being shared during the webinar. Uh, for CLE credit today, there will be a code announced at the end of the presentation, so please make sure to write down this code. You will be asked to submit it along with your CLE information in a follow-up form that will be sent out later today. So that is it from me, Jasmine, I will go ahead and hand it over to you to get us started. Thanks So much. Hi everyone. My name is Jasmine Singh and I'm your moderator today on behalf of Law Trades. Law Trades is an on-demand legal talent platform that I have used and loved for years, so I'm really excited to be moderating on their behalf. Um, I am general counsel at a company called binti, which is a SAS company that makes software for child welfare agencies to help support the foster and adoptive care processes. Uh, before binti, I was deputy GC at Patreon, and before that I was assistant GC at Pinterest. I started at Binti about two years ago as a solo GC who had a strong background in primarily commercial transactions. And before that in big law commercial litigation, um, as many of you fellow solo Juicies know, um, being a solo juicy in a space that's very complicated and delicate like child welfare during a major economic downturn where I was really limited in what resources I could use and in what advice I could help get from outside counsel, I started finding myself thinking a lot about the ethics of practicing while being stretched very thin. Um, and it's for that reason that I was really excited to moderate this panel. I, I knew that I wasn't alone in this feeling of, um, navigating what felt like the impossible task of balancing ethics and bandwidth. Um, the same balancing act can come in navigating the various other ethical issues that come our way as lawyers of tech companies generally",

And Catherine, I'll start with you. Hi, everyone. Uh, it's a pleasure to be here today. I was actually quite honored when they asked me to speak as part of this program. I mean, as a gc obviously you want to be constantly and consistently, if not the most ethical person in the room, part of the tone from the top, uh, kind of culture carrier with respect to high ethical standards at your organization. I think we have all seen firsthand too the pitfalls of having issues, um, even if unethical, improper inappropriate, that can create legal work for ourselves when that happens. Um, I am Chief Legal officer of SIBO Digital, which is a regulated, uh, platform exchange and clearinghouse for crypto futures derivatives and spot. Prior to that, I was general counsel of Maple Finance, uh, which was decentralized finance, um, a defi protocol in crypto purview, particularly interesting during 2022.

So lots to talk about with respect to all three of those roles. I'll also say that I think from my perspective, how I see this discussion, and we're gonna talk a little bit more about this. Jasmine alluded to this, but in the tech space, but particularly in the crypto space, we are at a very interesting time. We're oftentimes, uh, crypto market participants, their best practices inherently conflict with the position certain regulators are taking. So you have to ask yourself, is this unethical? Is this in, in inappropriate, is this illegal? Or, you know, my question that I'm always asking myself, can I sleep at night? Can I sit across the table from a regulator with a straight face and articulate my position based on the precedent? 'cause there's nothing in the law about this. So we'll talk a little bit more about that, but that's definitely something that I think about all the time. Thanks so much, Catherine. We're so excited that you're here and we're gonna get to hear a little bit about your experience and insight. Um, Amelia, I turn it over to you for a quick introduction as well. Sure. Thank you. Um, my name's Amelia Hinky. I am the Vice President of Legal at Business Solver. We do health and welfare benefits administration.

I don't know that I am truly an expert in this space, but I think we all have to kind of navigate and figure out, um, how to, how to conduct ourselves ethically in these organizations. Um, because I had a dual hat role, um, overseeing the legal and HR operations in a previous, um, in a previous role, I think that can, um, create some challenges. I'm excited to kind of talk through that. Um, as well as just different things I've learned. I've, I've actually always been an in-house attorney. I don't have the practice, um, of, of being in private practice prior to joining an in-house organization. Uh, and so I think that there is, you know, there's a lot that, um, when you're in-house, you're kind of acting at, in a dual attorney and a business advisor role that you have to kind of walk a fine line. So I'm, I'm anxious to dig in and, and participate in today's conversation. Right. Thanks so much, Amelia. And you, you make such a great point, which is n none of us know whether we're experts in this space for a few reasons. One is it's constantly changing and it's complicated. And another, I think is it, this is not the easiest topic to discuss because oftentimes we might be afraid that we're not doing it right or that we got it wrong, right? And people don't love talking about those moments, especially when it comes to things like ethics.

We wanna address scenarios where business or clients, frankly just may not be truthful with us, and how we handle things like control person liability in those situations. Um, we wanna talk about how we as GCs foster a culture of professionalism, not just within our legal team, but across the business because we are advisors and executives within our companies, um, and navigating ethical dilemmas that can come alongside emerging technologies. Um, and really what I'm hoping that all of you get out of this panel is, um, a lot of insight from Catherine and Millie, in particular for practical methods to encourage compliance and integrity. What are some real world tips and things that each one of us are doing to help drive compliance, ethics, um, and sort of good practices and leadership in our organizations? So I'm gonna start with, with, with what I think is a really, really hard question. Uh, what happens if your business is not telling you the truth? Um, they're not giving you the whole story",

You know, they maintain that they're telling you the truth, but what you know is you know that they're not, um, what do you do in those circumstances? How do you navigate that very hard scenario? Um, Catherine, let's start with you. So this arises in a couple different contexts. Um, one, when you join a new organization, I, I think that this has happened to many people where you can only get so much information through the interview process or publicly available information. And then you get in the role and you're like, oh, oh, no. And I, there's a spectrum. I mean, obviously your organization is not necessarily lying to you or lied to you. Maybe they didn't just, you know, they neglected to share some facet of information. I mean, lying by omission can be a little harsh. Uh, but that has happened to, I think, a lot of us where you realize maybe something unethical happened, maybe something inappropriate. There's a spectrum, maybe something where, okay, now I just need to remediate this. Uh, so that's happened a lot. That's probably the least worst situation. Um, you know, one anecdote that I can share is when I was in private practice, I did white collar defense. So most of the time it was representation of large entities in US government investigations, primarily DOJ, but name the regulator, did it, O-C-C-S-E-C, et cetera, all the acronyms. And sometimes it was individual defense. Most of the time it was entity defense. Sometimes it was individual defense. Sometimes it was defense of c-suite executives that were just getting interviewed as part of the process. Well, there's also a spectrum of truth telling",

Like I was definitely in a couple situations where I was not convinced that my client was telling me the truth. Hmm. Sometimes I felt like I had one client in particular where I felt like he was lying to me outright. However, I didn't have evidence of that, uh, one client where I just felt like they weren't telling me the whole story. Again, kind of, is this lying by omission? Yes or no? There's a few things you can do in those scenarios, and this applies to private practice to some degrees, but it's even more important in-house. I mean, in private practice, you can fire your client. And in-house, you can also fire your client. Meaning no one ever wants to discuss this, but I have known individuals that have had to give their business an ultimatum. Like, here's my risk appetite. You choose to do this. You choose to take this course of action, that's fine, will part as friends, good luck, goodbye. Sometimes it's not will part, as friends, sometimes you might have a reporting obligation as a control person, for example. So you can always go to the extreme if it's a, if it's a case where there's some sort of unethical conduct that implicates truly illegal contact conduct, you really need to consider, do I need to go nuclear here? Do I need to consider firing my client, firing myself, you know, firing my in-house client. The other spectrum is you just convey to your client, and this is what I would do, is you're making my job 10,000 times harder. Mm-Hmm",

And so I think that from my perspective, the most important thing I do when I start a new role, um, is really to work on building those relationships and building trust within the organization, hopefully to keep, to keep my client from lying by omission, from not telling me the whole story. Things like that. Sometimes that works and sometimes that doesn't. Um, I've had, uh, a lot of luck cultivating that trust in the organization that I'm at now. Um, that was something that was really important to me in a prior role. I led with that. Um, and I noticed that the, the communication and messaging that, that they were portraying outward so to potential clients, to, um, potential employees, uh, that were going through the interview process, didn't necessarily match up what was happening within the organization. Um, and for me, it wasn't, uh, that they were breaking any laws or, um, or even lying. It just seemed as though actions didn't match words. Um, and that's where I had to take a, a long hard look and, and see how clear am I about what matters to me and my ethics, and are my ethics aligned with the ethics of the organization. Um, and so when I think about going nuclear, it was not in that situation, uh, um, a big scary reaction that I had that, you know, you're gonna go to jail, you're breaking these laws. It wasn't anything like that, but it was, I can't continue to align myself with an organization that is not telling me the truth is not, um, doing what they say they're doing",

I think a, a couple of gems from what you said is it, it can be sometimes challenging to just navigate this feeling of, I don't feel comfortable with what's happening, but I also feel like I should be the one to help make it better. And how do you decide where on the spectrum you fall on any given day, which is, I feel uncomfortable and maybe I should walk away, versus I feel uncomfortable and I, I can improve this situation, or I can steer the ship in a better direction.

I had to kind of be really clear about assessing, okay.

I, I, the additional recall I'll offer, and this will pull from another one of your threads, Amelia, about the sales team in particular, is, you know, oftentimes sales teams have different, um, charters or missions of their own, right? Like, by any means possible, which they, they may take as like, I can break any rule and I can do whatever I want, if that's the charge that my leadership is giving me. Or sort of like, do anything possible, breakthrough walls, but do it in a way that's ethical and compliant. And, you know, I, that is, I think the, the tread that my team tend tends to take is we wanna do anything to break through these walls, and we don't wanna break rules. We respect rules, especially 'cause we at ti do government contracts. Mm-Hmm. Um, but what's really fascinating for me in the ethical space of government contracts is we have a lot of folks that come from bigger organizations who will say to me things like, Jasmine, you're telling me I'm not allowed to do X, Y, and Z, but I did it at so and so big company. And so I'm not sure why we're being more risk averse than them, or, you know, uh, I, I'm pretty sure it's allowed because I've done this a thousand times before.

And, you know, how do you make sure that you, yourself, can, Catherine speaking to your point earlier, sleep at night, feeling like you gave the right advice in the context of your company, your business, and yourself.

Like, we're presuming that the ethical quandary is gonna arise from the business. So you know, we're gonna be the ones to step in and fix, but there's also, as equally as an important task as GC to be comfortable with your own ethical standards with respect to dispensing advice. Mm-Hmm. And especially for the solo GCs out there. I hear you. I see you. When I left private practice and became a gc, I was a solo gc and I had an investigations regulatory litigation background. So you can imagine, I mean, a lot of the traditional m and a corporate work, I was kind of like, I have no idea what I'm doing. Right. And I think we've had a, a lot of people have had that, whether it's industry specific, there's gaps, whether it's practice specific, it's hard to go into a GC role where you don't have that. And, you know, different GCs cover different areas. For example, at sibo, I'm able to rely on some of the SIBO legal team, which I wasn't able to do at Maple. So with those types of issues, per maybe it is arguably unethical to give advice to your client, to your organization if you really have no idea what you're talking about. So you have to assess your own standards and your own comfort level in terms of what you're willing to teach yourself or learn versus what you're willing to say, no, I need to put my foot down. I need to talk to outside counsel. I need additional resources. My way of dealing with that was always understanding the spectrum of risk to the company. Mm-Hmm",

    "text": ". Like, we're presuming that the ethical quandary is gonna arise from the business. So you know, we're gonna be the ones to step in and fix, but there's also, as equally as an important task as GC to be comfortable with your own ethical standards with respect to dispensing advice. Mm-Hmm. And especially for the solo GCs out there. I hear you. I see you. When I left private practice and became a gc, I was a solo gc and I had an investigations regulatory litigation background. So you can imagine, I mean, a lot of the traditional m and a corporate work, I was kind of like, I have no idea what I'm doing. Right. And I think we've had a, a lot of people have had that, whether it's industry specific, there's gaps, whether it's practice specific, it's hard to go into a GC role where you don't have that. And, you know, different GCs cover different areas. For example, at sibo, I'm able to rely on some of the SIBO legal team, which I wasn't able to do at Maple. So with those types of issues, per maybe it is arguably unethical to give advice to your client, to your organization if you really have no idea what you're talking about. So you have to assess your own standards and your own comfort level in terms of what you're willing to teach yourself or learn versus what you're willing to say, no, I need to put my foot down. I need to talk to outside counsel. I need additional resources. My way of dealing with that was always understanding the spectrum of risk to the company. Mm-Hmm. So if this was something like an NDA or a garden variety contract or a training where, you know, you could go in to L suite and pull a sample and you could feel comfortable that even if you messed it up, the risk or the damage to the organization was almost non-existent or immaterial, sure, go do it. Go educate yourself. Go learn. But you know, even if you don't know what you're talking about, you do understand how much damage, for example, you know, having a, a damages provision in a contract, like in a significant deal, could, could, you know, exert or a lot of the other scenarios where it could be quasi existential to your company. Those are the ones where you need to assess, are you well placed to go out on a limb and advise your client? Mm-Hmm. Amelia, how have you dealt with that sort of ethical quandary of like, n not necessarily knowing all the substantive answers, but feeling like you maybe should or want to know or want to answer? Yeah, I think, um, as a, you know, generalist, by the nature of always having been in-house, um, my knowledge is broad, but not super deep in certain areas. So, um, so like Catherine said, I have to get comfortable in the areas where I feel comfortable giving advice, and also really understand what it would take for me to get the depth of knowledge, um, needed to answer the question",

Um, get the quick answer, and then we can kind of decide from there.

But thank you both for the insight there. Um, let's, let's change gears a little bit to, I think another topic that a lot of folks are eager to hear about, which is, um, regulatory posture, regulatory position, and when it runs counter to legal strategy. So the overarching question here is, do you think it's unethical to have a legal strategy that runs counter to a regulatory position? Um, and how do you ensure that what you're doing is ethical when there actually is no law or rule with respect to something that the business wants to pursue? So it's sort of a two part question. Um, Amelia, we'll start with you this time, and then Catherine Head over to you. Oh, I think this one, uh, is probably better posed to Catherine, uh, just given her her role. Um, I know my, our industries are not super highly regulated, so Yeah. I'm jealous of Amelia. I'm very jealous. Uh, no, I mean, I think this is a great point because as the law with emerging technologies and it tech grows and changes, like this is obviously a huge issue for crypto, for AI or cannabis.

Like, what, how do you navigate an unregulated field for a one? You know, how do you know what is and is not okay? I think the first thing I always do is assess a spectrum of risk. You know, like with respect to looking at crypto, I always say that there's three big areas of risk. One is kind of technical hack, um, integrity, like, or your smart contracts good. Is your code good? Like obviously there's massive issues. There is, are your privacy incident response areas great. You know, you don't mess with that because like, again, that's, that's pretty existential and easy to fill a gap. Two criminal also something you don't mess with. You know, do you have, uh, A-M-L-K-Y-C sanctions in place? If you don't, you better have a darn good reason why you don't. If you're dealing with flow of funds, like, is your position justi justifiable with respect to, you know, are you, you know, theoretically helping a flow of dirty money? And this could be considered a national security risk. Like how are you dealing with that? You need to have an answer to that, and it needs to be a very good one. The third one, regulatory, like civil regulators, cryptos, it's no, no, uh, no secret that cryptos parts of crypto are kind of at war with the SEC. Well, how, how is that? Okay.

I would always say that at Maple, I spent a lot of time on a proactive, regular regulatory strategy that enabled me to feel comfortable that this was justifiable based on everything that existed. Whether that is law precedent, rules, guidance, like anything that was out there, I had a response. Now, would the SEC agree with my response? Probably not. But if put in front of a neutral arbiter like a judge, could I advocate for this position with a straight face? Could I convince potential strategic partners that I had done a degree of diligence on the regulatory risk? If those answers need to be, yes, those answers absolutely need to be yes. If they're not, then you're in a problematic space, you know, basically from a practical viewpoint, but also potentially from an ethical viewpoint. Hmm. So there's a lot of gray area. Part of being a GC is just having a strategy as to how to proactively navigate that gray area, ideally before you have to deal with an inquiry or with an issue. Mm-Hmm. Can, let's talk a little bit how you navigated that gray area in terms of leaning on outside counsel. Um, what, what would you do in terms of asking them for their input and advice and, you know, guidance along the way? That's really tough, particularly with crypto, and again, areas of emerging technologies that are rife with risk. A lot of outside counsel these days will not give you a definitive answer, you know?

You might be able to find like a law firm in Gibraltar, but you know, no credible law firm is going to enable you to, to give you a full CYA. However, uh, this, this is often something I deploy with novel products. We are taking the position that this novel product feeds, fits this regulatory mold and is permissible because of X, Y, Z. It's a reasonable interpretation. We will seek outside counsel advice to confirm our understanding and interpretation. Mm-Hmm. Now that outside counsel memo might have caveats, but if it's overwhelmingly in support of our position, then not only do we look more credible, it's like, like an advocacy piece. It also underscores the fact that we are trying to be an ethical, you know, entity. We're trying to be a good actor in the space. We're taking our responsibilities in terms of, you know, uh, creating novel products that are good for the marketplace or, or, you know, needed in de in demand by the market participants.

And so, I think sometimes what tends to happen in, in my world is sort of this open question of, well, hey, government agency, I presume that you have the permission to do what you're doing, but actually I'm gonna stop assuming that, uh, you know, 'cause there are, there are moments where there is an open question of like, do you have the right to give me the data of these people that you're sharing? And you know, I know you've never been asked that question before, and I'm sorry to offend you, but like, this is actually part of my ethical obligation to make sure that like we in turn have the right to process this data in the ways that you're telling us to. So there's, there's an, this is less regulatory, but more really exposing that, like, sometimes there just aren't rules that cover what we do. Sometimes it's just unclear. And, um, you know, that vagueness can be a moment where you have to decide what the North Star is. And at Binti, for example, our North Star is putting children first, right? Because we support fostered adoptive care. And so all of our data decisions really index on our, is this in service of children? Because there isn't a rule that says X, Y, or Z with respect to what we can do, but is it protecting their data in the way that we know we want to, or that we care about? And that's the internal question to sort of your point with internal level setting something that I do as well, which is, you know, whenever we get internal questions about like, well, can't we just duplicate the data and put it in, blah, blah, blah",

But, uh, really, like, you could, you could apply the same principle to, uh, your due diligence on strategic counterparties. Mm-Hmm.

What are they doing? What are they doing? And you know, I've been dismissed in the past where it's like, oh, it's three ac. All the crypto people will know that they're huge.

Um, one is trust through transparency. Um, and so I think when we think about being transparent, um, that means I need to be transparent with the leadership team as I'm giving legal advice, right? I need to be able to paint the picture of, is this, you know, is this a real risk? Is this a perceived risk? And, and really how bad is it? But then that needs to trickle down to the, the, you know, boots on the ground, the people doing, um, doing the work. But then I also think about my direct reports, um, and, and the importance of transparency and building that trust, um, in, in reporting relationships. Um, you know, I have to be transparent with them.

The other thing that I would like to add is, so when I was at King and Spalding, the leader of our group of the white collar group was Chris Ray, who's now our FBI director. And, you know, politics put aside, Chris is one of the most ethical people I've ever met in my life. And I will say having him as a beacon for every other lawyer in that practice was fantastic. Like, he was an inspiration for me. It was kind of a, what would Chris do? I have a friend who's a gc, um, I, I won't name him, although he probably wouldn't be interested. He actually jokingly gave out wristbands like, uh, ww g uh, d like what would Greg do like to his c-suite? 'cause he wanted to be a constant reminder, like if they were struggling or if they were, they had an issue, they, he wanted to be, you know, on their shoulder, in their head at all times. So if you are a good example for not just your legal team, but for the rest of the team, like they know, like they take pride in the fact that they have, uh, you know, a strategic partner that's going to steer the ship. Well, that can be really inspirational. And then the other thing to convey to them too is I think most people don't understand the concept of control person liability. We haven't talked about that at all in this presentation",

We haven't talked about that at all in this presentation. And it's actually essential when you're talking about ethics. Mm-Hmm. So occasionally I have reminded or informed people in the business, like I'm a control person. Like, if we get sued, like I am theoretically on the hook, like I could be subject to, you know, regulatory issues, potentially even criminal liability for my acts on behalf of the organization. So this is how seriously I take it. I take it seriously 'cause it's my job, but I also take it seriously because, you know, this is my career on the line. Mm-Hmm. So like that's going to make me, you know, make the business really understand why you're doing what you're doing. Mm-Hmm. Yeah. I, I, I think to, to distill and pull out some gems from what you're all saying is, you know, the, the methods within the organization I think can be broken up into a couple different groups. One is lead by example, right? So be a beacon of transparency, of truth, of honesty, of carrying whatever the ethos of the company is. Another is sort of make sure people know the why behind the what, uh, whether that's explaining the regulatory position or your individual investment in compliance and ethical practice. So making sure that they understand in plain English what it is that is informing the company's position and your defense of that position",

And it seems like another Amelia, from what you were saying, another pull for you is really, you know, going back to that point about empathy is making it so you know, you are transparent enough, uh, and, and empathetic enough that you can get people to come to you and really share what it is that maybe they're struggling with. Um, and the thing I, I can maybe add as like a sub bucket under there is, you know, the approachability factor, especially in high growth tech companies, I think really cannot be overestimated.

Like, it's okay to be a little uncomfortable, especially when you're learning, right? But it's not okay to be uncomfortable to the point where, you know, like your moral and ethical compass is spinning in the wrong direction. You know, look, there is definitely a spectrum of that. Like, people are gonna have a different, you know, kind of moral standard, or we shouldn't even call it morality. We should say appetite for risk. Sometimes the JC isn't a fit because they have an appetite for risk that doesn't align with the company. But make sure that if your appetite for risk doesn't align with the company, then you either find an alternative job or you get comfortable with the risk that they're taking. So you can kind of ensure that you're advocating on behalf of a client that you believe in. You're not exposing yourself to control person liability, and that your longer term future isn't compromised. Like, those are all things that are very selfish, selfish as part of this calculus, but they're also really important from the kind of top down ethos of the organization. Mm-Hmm.

And none of us know the answer to everything.

Um, and so I came to know more deeply that while sometimes maybe precedent or other people's experience can be informative in helping address those issues, what's really steering my sort of ethical practice right now is commitment to my own sense of ethics coupled with an understanding of what the company's ethics and ethos are. And so you really have to deeply know who your company is, who it's made of, and what they believe and what their North Star orientation is. And also who you are, right?

I've, um, had the pleasure of hearing her speak before, so I know that we're in for a real treat today, and she's speaking today on diversity and inclusion, which in today's, um, political and legal climate, um, is definitely a hot topic for us to be discussing. And, um, being a, a leader in an organization in the general counsel role, really now is not just something that we, um, that we should be thinking about and being a leader on, but really something that we must be thinking about and being a leader on. So, um, Jill's led the, the legal team, not just at Etsy, but before that, at some of the largest and most recognizable publicly traded companies, and she's going to be sharing her wisdom with us here today. Thank you. Hi, everybody. So I'm here before the wine, huh? Um, are we up there? Yeah. So first of all, thank you and thanks, tech juicy for inviting me. Um, so I think, uh, first of all, what's Etsy? We are, um, a homegrown New York, uh, tech tech company. We are a marketplace for unique, um, handcrafted vintage goods. And, um, we have pretty unusual stats for a tech company. We have about 2 million active sellers. Um, more than 87% of them, um, of our sellers identify as women. Um, we have a 50 50 board gender split, um, and the number of leaders in our tech, in our tech company, which is also a little bit unusual, who identifies women, is a little over 52%. And so, uh, that has led to us being a company that's perceived and actually is pretty good on gender diversity. Um, we have, uh, a generous parental leave, uh, six months, uh, of paid leave, which I think is probably industry leading. Um, we have, uh, gender neutral bathrooms. We were one of the first companies to do that. Um, we've done pay equity studies and we share the results with our board and publicly and with our employees. Um, we've done a lot of things that really have focused on, uh, gender equity. And as a result, um, we've really built a company that is a pretty, um, gender balanced workplace. Um, with our parental leave, we got some notice for a lot of notice for that. Um, we made it, um, applicable to both men and women. Um, and we wanted, we did that because we wanted to make sure that there wasn't a knock on effect in women taking a leave and then sort of falling behind in their careers. So both women and men both qualify for six months leave. And as a result of this very intentional, um, uh, efforts in gender balance, having a brand that certainly attracts women, brought in a lot of women, women tend to bring in other women. Um, we ended up with a tech company that has, um, and has historically had a, uh, pretty impressive gender balanced even more women than men. And even, I suppose you're asking, well, what about the tech roles? Um, even when you double click on the, on the, the tech groups within the company, you'll see that there's a pretty high percentage of women there",

There's still further to go, but we're certainly ahead of most of our peers. But when you dig in, and this is one of the questions I asked when I first went to Etsy in 2017. Well, what about everyone else? Another picture started to emerge, and we had to acknowledge that while we were doing really great on gender balance for a tech company, we weren't really doing as well in attracting other groups of people and really focusing on other protected classes. And so you can see here that there's a, there's a, there's a big, there's a big gap and a big, a long way to go for, um, racial, racial diversity. And so I wasn't the only one to notice this. We started be some being suppressed that Etsy's still a white man and women's world, and it really was a company that had a lot of good intentions. Um, we're a company where, um, people really, folk, we did tons of unconscious bias training. People were talking a lot about diversity. People were, um, we were hiring consultants, we were doing studies, and yet we weren't moving the needle. And so the question really was, you have a lot of good intentions. People are activated. We weren't debating whether there were virtues of diversity, whether the diversity was important part of, of our values and important part of the strength of our company, and yet we weren't moving the needle. And so the question is, what do you do? How do you, how do you get, how do you get to action? And so, at the same time, and this was around 2 20 17, I arrived in January. Um, s**t happened, uh, Etsy. Etsy had activists",

And the prevailing attitude was that we needed to stop with the artisanal snacks, and we needed to stop, you know, looming and having, you know, quirky Halloween parties. And we needed to really focus on the bottom line. And it was really an either or choice. And you can, I love deal breaker. And the, the, the hope of, uh, of deal breaker, and I think others, was that we, we had made the choice when we were gonna turn to the dark side. And I love this. Now that they're done trying to do good or whatever, Etsy has some actual value. Um, the good news is that what we realized, we had a new CEO and he really, um, was very focused on us, uh, figuring out how to be a profitable company. But he also firmly believed that the values of Etsy were part of what made us great. Um, and so that we weren't throwing out the baby with the bath water, and that we were really focusing on our business. And a core component of our business was the fact that we were a good, good company, and we didn't have to choose between being a company that does good and being a company that was successful. And so, at that point, at that, at that sort of pivotal moment, we had to say, you know, what does building a diverse workplace culture mean for Etsy? What is Etsy all about?

And we needed to really focus on the bottom line. And it was really an either or choice. And you can, I love deal breaker. And the, the, the hope of, uh, of deal breaker, and I think others, was that we, we had made the choice when we were gonna turn to the dark side. And I love this. Now that they're done trying to do good or whatever, Etsy has some actual value. Um, the good news is that what we realized, we had a new CEO and he really, um, was very focused on us, uh, figuring out how to be a profitable company. But he also firmly believed that the values of Etsy were part of what made us great. Um, and so that we weren't throwing out the baby with the bath water, and that we were really focusing on our business. And a core component of our business was the fact that we were a good, good company, and we didn't have to choose between being a company that does good and being a company that was successful. And so, at that point, at that, at that sort of pivotal moment, we had to say, you know, what does building a diverse workplace culture mean for Etsy? What is Etsy all about? And so this began a larger process in the company. We came up with a new mission, and we, our new mission is, is to keep commerce human. And what does that really mean? It means that we're a company that's really about human connections. And if anyone's ever bought anything on Etsy, you know, that you're buying from like some quirky Mary Sue in Kansas City, and she's gonna, you know, send it with a little note and maybe a little piece of candy. And that's like a very human thing in today's modern world. Um, I had a friend this past year who, um, passed away from with breast cancer. I wanted to get something that was very personal for her family that was related to some fabric. She designed. I sent the fabric to, um, this woman. She designed these very personal and beautiful things. She shared her story of her loss for a friend with, um, cancer. And it was the most incredible, um, e-commerce experience I've ever had. Um, this is Etsy. Etsy is about the people. It's not just about our sellers, it's about our employees, it's about our vendors. It's about the entire ecosystem that we're trying to create. So how does that translate? And so from there, we built some guiding principles and, you know, commit to our craft. Yes, okay, sure, there's a pun 'cause we're Etsy. But really we're talking about talent and we're talking about valuing people based on their performance, not on perceptions, not on, you know, oh, you went to my college, but really focusing on talent and performance, minimizing waste",

You'll see in a minute we developed an impact goal that was really valuing, um, our, our resources, embracing differences that goes directly to diversity. Um, digging deeper, leading with optimism. And these guiding principles became how we start talking about things and thinking about how we show up at work, how we treat others, how we value ourselves, and how we make for an equitable workplace. Now, as we were building our business goals, one of the things our new CEO Josh Silverman said was really, we had to, um, we had to focus on fewer things. When he arrived also in 2017, we were doing 20,000 really great things. And he said, let's pick 10. What are the most important things to move the needle? And let's do those things really well, and let's measure them. Let's set KPIs, measure our success, and then we will figure out how to move the needle with 10 things. And that's a hard decision with our impact and social goals. Before 2017, we also, we were doing a lot of really great things. We had a million speakers come in. We had initiatives, we had, um, lots of, lots of workshops, but we weren't moving the needle. And so also with our impact initiatives, we decide let's focus on the key things. What are the most important impact initiatives we can do as Etsy? And how do we make it not a silo over there, but how do we integrate it into our culture so that everybody owns these things? And so we picked three, we wanted to focus on economic impact. And let's face it, that's our day job",

Their, their businesses are one, and it changes their lives. We, um, focus on social impact, which is diversity. And in terms of that, we're talking about employees. We're talking about our brand, we're talking about vendors, we're talking about our whole Etsy ecosystem. And then we're talking about ecological impact. And that was really what's our carbon footprint and what can we do to make it smaller? Now, I could sit here and talk to you about all three of these topics. That's not my topic today. Um, that's for another day. But we, if you wanna look in our, our k we've, we, our 10 K, um, we report on all of these and we've really made some goals, um, some, some progress on our goals. So really what we're talking about, when you take three impact goals and you say they're not separate from your business, when you say they're part of your overall business initiative, then you're talking about integrating impact, social impact into your business model. And what we are viewing it as is a flywheel. Because if we don't have a diverse workplace, if we're not hiring vendors that support our values, if we're, if we're, if we're polluting all over the place, if we're not rewarding fairly and equitably, then we're not creating a business that's sustainable. And by putting them together, everybody owns diversity. Everybody owns building an equitable workplace. And then you start creating a flywheel. And this is what we saw with women when I started.

We saw really great talented women coming to Etsy naturally because of our brand. And we saw them inviting and, and bringing on other talented women. And we saw them building a workplace that was equitable based on gender, and it created a flywheel in which that was really successful. And so what we realized is that we needed to create a flywheel for everybody, and we needed to create a flywheel in which we were really addressing with data how to make Etsy a more diverse and inclusive workplace. So this is Etsy's, uh, diversity goal to enable equitable access to the opportunities that we create. It's a pretty broad goal. And we decided that was really our overarching longer term goal, but specifically, we set three sub goals. I don't know if you can see that, but, um, they're around employees, vendors, and the marketplace. And they're really specific goals for employees. We wanted to double the percentage of black, black and Latinx employees and NCS workforce by 2023 for vendors. We wanted to focus more on, um, equitable and sustainable vendors. Um, and we didn't even have a real, I would say a real vendor management system. So there's a lot of infrastructure that would have to happen to have that to, to get us there. Um, and in our marketplace, we wanted to be more inclusive and welcoming. I can't tell you every time I walk into a room and say, I am from Etsy, the women at the table say, oh, I love Etsy.

And the answer is that, um, I and my team have been really involved in this entire process.

We looked at the data in our advertising, we looked at the data in pictures on our website, and we said, where are we falling off? How do we begin to address this holistically? And we started to ask these five questions. There are questions around recruiting, hiring, retaining, promoting, and measuring. And I'll go through these one by one. How do you attract a diverse set of candidates into your pipeline? One of the things we had to acknowledge was that our pipeline was unequal. We were attracting tons and tons of women.

And we looked at the data and we were able to set up, um, areas of focus for different groups. So where do you focus? It's gonna vary from person to person, from company to company. It might even vary team to team. But you can look at your recruiting data and say, where are groups falling off and how can we focus our recruiting specifically to target different groups? We reviewed our recruiting materials. We realized, like the first picture I opened up, you saw there's a picture of people crafting in hands. We realized a lot of our pictures, the hands were all white. What is that? That sense? A really strong message about who etsy's for. So we started looking at our recruiting materials, and we wanted to reflect the diversity of, of the culture. We, we, we wanted to build who's going to job fairs? We started asking that question, and we realized that the same two, um, people from HR were going to all the job fairs. They didn't represent, they didn't represent diversity, um, but they also didn't represent the diversity of the work in our, in our, in our company. And so we started inviting people from different areas, people, people who are engineers, people in hr, people in marketing. And we started presenting a more diverse portfolio of our employees.

Um, so what we did was we started talking more to the candidates about why we're collecting this data. We're collecting it for good reasons. We, these are our diversity goals. We're interested in building a diverse workforce. And when you do that, then you start to unlock this problem of, of people disclosing, um, hiring panel. We also realized we were, we would go and we'd have, we'd be bringing in a diverse can, uh, panel of candidates, and then we'd look and it would be, you know, five, uh, white guy engineers on the hiring panel. We're like, that doesn't even reflect our company. But it happened, you know, accidentally. So we're trying to be more conscious about the diversity of our panels. Um, we also work with HR to make it a more hospitable process. We make sure that they're aware of what's going on, that they're aware that there's a regular process, that they're part of it. Um, and we also maintain an internal pipeline. This person was really great. This is a really great candidate, not for this role, but we're conscious about just not letting them drop into the endless bucket of like, oh, not this role. Maybe never. Um, but really when we find a great candidate referring them for other roles, retaining, Um, we run, we, we do an annual, do people here do engagement surveys? Yeah, we do a, an engagement survey. And that's really great for uncovering hotspots. We discover that, oh my gosh, there's a perception of unfairness on the X team. That's something that we really wanna address, or so and so is a, a manager who is, you know, showing what appears to be a lot of bias. Um, we do comp surveys to make sure that comp is equitable. When we do, um, we have set up a mentorship program. We focus on the, we've built a vendor, um, screening program",

Do you train them on sexual harassment? We wanna make sure that we're working with good vendors. Um, we have set up and funded employee resource groups, and as I said before, we're making sure that we're not overly taxing them. Um, we maintain anti-harassment and non-discrimination policies and training, um, and we train managers to handle, uh, sensitive issues. This has been really interesting. We found that the online training didn't really work with managers. 'cause people would come and say, we have a lot of really young managers. And their friend would be like, oh my gosh, I was at the bar last night with like a bunch of, you know, engineers, and someone was like a little bit handsy and they would not see that as a report of harassment. And they felt like that was their friend, even though they're now managing them. And so we really had to train a workforce of young managers to understand when something is a report of harassment or other, other situation and find and, uh, promote. How do you ensure that promotion processes are fair, consistent, inclusive? Uh, we've recently completely overhauled our promotion process. We do calibrations across the entire, um, org.
