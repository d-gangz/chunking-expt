**[Speaker nan]**


[0.2 - 5.6] Hi everyone.

**[Speaker nan]**


[5.6 - 8.8] I'm Louisa Daniels general counsel

**[Speaker nan]**


[8.8 - 10.9] for recursion Pharmaceuticals.

**[Speaker nan]**


[11.6 - 16.6] I joined recursion halfway through

**[Speaker nan]**


[16.6 - 19.2] the IPO preparation stage. I

**[Speaker nan]**


[19.2 - 22.4] would say or or probably three quarters of the way through

**[Speaker nan]**


[22.4 - 25.9] and that was in January of 2021. We

**[Speaker nan]**


[25.9 - 29.7] went public in on April 15th 2021.

**[Speaker nan]**


[28.7 - 31.9] So we just made it before in

**[Speaker nan]**


[31.9 - 34.3] the market completely changed had a

**[Speaker nan]**


[34.3 - 38.4] very big IPO, but we did it very very fast and

**[Speaker nan]**


[37.4 - 41.3] recursion is part of

**[Speaker nan]**


[41.3 - 44.9] the new wave of tech enabled drug Discovery companies.

**[Speaker nan]**


[44.9 - 47.8] We have an AI machine learning platform

**[Speaker nan]**


[47.8 - 50.8] that we use with image-based

**[Speaker nan]**


[50.8 - 53.5] processing to develop essentially maps

**[Speaker nan]**


[53.5 - 57.1] of human biology, and we now have four compounds

**[Speaker nan]**


[56.1 - 59.1] in the clinic. So we're

**[Speaker nan]**


[59.1 - 62.3] judged as a biopharma company as well.

**[Speaker nan]**


[62.3 - 65.7] I'll leave it at that deaf. You

**[Speaker nan]**


[65.7 - 68.4] can introduce yourself and I'm Jeff lassage. I'm

**[Speaker nan]**


[68.4 - 71.4] one of the founders of liquid stock we

**[Speaker nan]**


[71.5 - 75.5] Provide structured Equity financing to free IPO

**[Speaker nan]**


[75.5 - 78.2] companies. It's really a hybrid between a loan and

**[Speaker nan]**


[78.2 - 78.4] a sale.

**[Speaker nan]**


[79.1 - 82.3] And we wanted Luisa here to make all

**[Speaker nan]**


[82.3 - 83.5] the general counsels. Who are

**[Speaker nan]**


[84.2 - 87.1] Facing all the pressure be really jealous of someone who

**[Speaker nan]**


[87.1 - 90.5] got through her process of three months. I don't

**[Speaker nan]**


[90.5 - 93.2] think I don't think you should be jealous. It was

**[Speaker nan]**


[93.2 - 94.5] very very hard.

**[Speaker nan]**


[95.1 - 98.3] You know, we we took about

**[Speaker nan]**


[98.3 - 101.8] four months to do all of the preparation drafting

**[Speaker nan]**


[101.8 - 104.2] ES1. I mean you name it. It was

**[Speaker nan]**


[104.2 - 107.4] incredibly fast everything we do at recursion.

**[Speaker nan]**


[107.4 - 110.5] We do fast to a very high standard as well, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[110.5 - 114.0] I don't recommend it. So don't be don't be jealous. Actually.

**[Speaker nan]**


[113.6 - 117.0] The silver lining of current macroeconomic

**[Speaker nan]**


[116.6 - 119.8] conditions is that you do have a lot of time to

**[Speaker nan]**


[119.8 - 125.0] prepare for your IPO. Yeah times

**[Speaker nan]**


[124.3 - 127.4] times in this year. Yeah in both

**[Speaker nan]**


[127.4 - 128.0] directions. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[128.9 - 132.2] So, you know given the state

**[Speaker nan]**


[131.2 - 134.6] of the market right now Jeff

**[Speaker nan]**


[134.6 - 138.2] with the IPO window essentially closed

**[Speaker nan]**


[137.2 - 140.2] and no certainty on

**[Speaker nan]**


[140.2 - 144.7] when it may reopen. How do you how do you think IPO preparation

**[Speaker nan]**


[144.7 - 147.6] should be handled in terms of equity so from

**[Speaker nan]**


[147.6 - 150.3] that perspective and also just

**[Speaker nan]**


[150.3 - 153.2] to back up a little bit. I was also a partner Gibson done

**[Speaker nan]**


[153.2 - 156.8] where I practice Securities m&a venture capital

**[Speaker nan]**


[156.8 - 159.4] for 15 years. I've seen it. I've been through

**[Speaker nan]**


[159.4 - 163.6] both sides now both sides. So I saw 2001 2008

**[Speaker nan]**


[165.3 - 165.5] I would say.

**[Speaker nan]**


[166.6 - 169.9] From and we're dealing with a bunch of the private

**[Speaker nan]**


[169.9 - 171.1] company GCS now.

**[Speaker nan]**


[172.7 - 175.3] In in my time. There's never been a

**[Speaker nan]**


[175.3 - 178.4] more stressful time on the GC because of

**[Speaker nan]**


[178.4 - 182.0] that time and what's happening and you

**[Speaker nan]**


[181.2 - 185.1] see it in the news, but you have plans expiring

**[Speaker nan]**


[184.1 - 187.4] RSU plans in

**[Speaker nan]**


[187.4 - 187.6] particular.

**[Speaker nan]**


[188.3 - 192.1] So you have this combination of pressure from the c-suite

**[Speaker nan]**


[191.1 - 194.2] and the board not understanding.

**[Speaker nan]**


[195.1 - 198.7] the ramifications in particular the massive accounting

**[Speaker nan]**


[198.7 - 199.1] charges

**[Speaker nan]**


[199.8 - 202.7] Are potentially coming depending on how you

**[Speaker nan]**


[202.7 - 205.3] maneuver and then

**[Speaker nan]**


[205.3 - 209.5] you have the pressure of all of the employees and the

**[Speaker nan]**


[209.5 - 213.4] combination of of those as is is the

**[Speaker nan]**


[212.4 - 215.3] job of the GC now to

**[Speaker nan]**


[215.3 - 217.7] juggle and often if they were in the seat.

**[Speaker nan]**


[218.6 - 221.5] At the point time when the plans were adopted they're getting blamed.

**[Speaker nan]**


[222.2 - 225.2] For what what's you know the state of where the

**[Speaker nan]**


[225.2 - 225.5] company is?

**[Speaker nan]**


[226.4 - 229.0] But don't don't get too depressed by that we're going to

**[Speaker nan]**


[229.2 - 232.3] talk about we know accents that you can take and how to handle

**[Speaker nan]**


[232.3 - 235.4] that. But one thing that would be helpful. I think what do

**[Speaker nan]**


[235.4 - 239.0] you think if we take a poll of what staged

**[Speaker nan]**


[238.7 - 241.4] companies are at in the room right now?

**[Speaker nan]**


[241.4 - 245.2] So for example Angel to series

**[Speaker nan]**


[244.2 - 247.9] B's or anyone in the room whose companies

**[Speaker nan]**


[247.9 - 249.5] is at that stage.

**[Speaker nan]**


[251.1 - 254.6] Okay and see through

**[Speaker nan]**


[254.6 - 255.1] e

**[Speaker nan]**


[256.6 - 259.8] oh a lot of folks. Okay, that's really helpful to

**[Speaker nan]**


[259.8 - 263.6] know and how about people who

**[Speaker nan]**


[263.6 - 266.2] thought their companies would have been public by now already?

**[Speaker nan]**


[267.7 - 270.4] Not that many. Okay. So the sweet

**[Speaker nan]**


[270.4 - 274.0] spot is kind of series see through e so that's helpful. And another

**[Speaker nan]**


[273.1 - 276.4] thing we wanted to mention. If you have any

**[Speaker nan]**


[276.4 - 279.5] questions, feel free to raise your hand during the

**[Speaker nan]**


[279.5 - 283.8] discussion. You don't need to wait to the end and don't

**[Speaker nan]**


[283.8 - 286.9] feel shy about asking anything that

**[Speaker nan]**


[286.9 - 287.8] comes to mind.

**[Speaker nan]**


[289.9 - 292.7] so you talked about amending RSU plans

**[Speaker nan]**


[292.7 - 292.9] and

**[Speaker nan]**


[294.3 - 298.0] You know the drop-in Valley valuations, there's

**[Speaker nan]**


[297.2 - 300.5] a big debate on you know, sort of taking a second

**[Speaker nan]**


[300.5 - 303.3] bite of the Apple amending a plan for the second

**[Speaker nan]**


[303.3 - 306.4] time. Can you explain a little

**[Speaker nan]**


[306.4 - 310.9] more about why that's a big deal. You talked about accounting implications.

**[Speaker nan]**


[309.9 - 312.2] How are the companies

**[Speaker nan]**


[312.2 - 314.5] that you're working with handling this issue?

**[Speaker nan]**


[315.3 - 317.9] Yeah for all of you who are sort of in that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[318.7 - 322.1] sea that e range depending on the timing at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[321.1 - 324.3] my biggest takeaway now is to go out and read

**[Speaker nan]**


[324.3 - 327.2] all your plans because you may not know it but

**[Speaker nan]**


[327.2 - 330.9] but that plan expiration is gonna be coming

**[Speaker nan]**


[330.9 - 333.5] and it doesn't

**[Speaker nan]**


[333.5 - 334.9] look like that Windows going to be

**[Speaker nan]**


[335.6 - 338.3] Opening up for a lot of companies for some time

**[Speaker nan]**


[338.3 - 341.3] what what that

**[Speaker nan]**


[341.3 - 345.9] means varies? And so that

**[Speaker nan]**


[344.9 - 348.0] first what what we

**[Speaker nan]**


[347.4 - 350.3] saw references that first bite of the apple is

**[Speaker nan]**


[350.3 - 353.2] amending the RSU plan one

**[Speaker nan]**


[353.2 - 356.6] time typically is viewed is not causing

**[Speaker nan]**


[356.6 - 359.3] the IRS to look at that plan and say well

**[Speaker nan]**


[359.3 - 362.5] we think there's no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture.

**[Speaker nan]**


[363.2 - 367.0] and so you're allowing some segment of that RSU

**[Speaker nan]**


[366.2 - 370.5] class to actually accelerate convert

**[Speaker nan]**


[369.5 - 372.8] those rsues into shares and potentially

**[Speaker nan]**


[372.8 - 375.4] give them a liquidity event, whether that's thirst, you

**[Speaker nan]**


[375.4 - 377.2] know, a structured Equity Finance or

**[Speaker nan]**


[377.8 - 381.2] Through a tender offer. And so

**[Speaker nan]**


[381.2 - 384.2] then the the question comes if you've done that

**[Speaker nan]**


[384.2 - 384.5] once.

**[Speaker nan]**


[385.4 - 388.4] Can you do it again? And and I

**[Speaker nan]**


[388.4 - 388.4] think

**[Speaker nan]**


[390.3 - 393.7] most of the lawyers who are advising

**[Speaker nan]**


[393.7 - 396.9] the companies in the room and they accountants and tax

**[Speaker nan]**


[396.9 - 398.6] advisors are saying you cannot.

**[Speaker nan]**


[399.4 - 401.9] It's interesting to look now, though.

**[Speaker nan]**


[402.7 - 405.8] At this time and think about how long a time

**[Speaker nan]**


[405.8 - 408.3] period we potentially have to see

**[Speaker nan]**


[408.3 - 411.4] whether or not people are going to take a different position

**[Speaker nan]**


[411.4 - 414.0] on that now, but the main thing is

**[Speaker nan]**


[414.3 - 415.7] if you're RC plan goes away.

**[Speaker nan]**


[416.5 - 420.1] You've got a bunch of questions. You've got to answer and

**[Speaker nan]**


[419.1 - 422.9] on the top of the list is okay. What's

**[Speaker nan]**


[422.9 - 425.2] the accounting charge to re-up all of

**[Speaker nan]**


[425.2 - 428.6] your existing employees and oftentimes, that's

**[Speaker nan]**


[428.6 - 429.5] a massive hit.

**[Speaker nan]**


[430.3 - 433.3] Because those the value of of those rsues is

**[Speaker nan]**


[433.3 - 436.8] grown tremendously over time. Maybe it's come down. So but even

**[Speaker nan]**


[436.8 - 439.3] in that in that view at the time, you're CFO

**[Speaker nan]**


[439.3 - 442.5] is trying to keep your balance sheet pristine and one

**[Speaker nan]**


[442.5 - 445.6] of the room. Yeah, so you need to also keep in

**[Speaker nan]**


[445.6 - 448.8] mind how much pressure is coming from the employees for

**[Speaker nan]**


[448.8 - 450.1] liquidity event.

**[Speaker nan]**


[451.5 - 454.3] That depends on how large your employee bases how long

**[Speaker nan]**


[454.3 - 455.9] they've been with the company.

**[Speaker nan]**


[457.7 - 460.5] You know how much the valuation has changed. So

**[Speaker nan]**


[460.5 - 463.3] one thing I'm curious about is had what companies

**[Speaker nan]**


[463.3 - 466.2] do you think have done this? Well, how many you know

**[Speaker nan]**


[466.2 - 469.4] who has done it poorly on who is maybe in a

**[Speaker nan]**


[469.4 - 470.8] sort of waiting?

**[Speaker nan]**


[471.6 - 474.3] Waiting stage. I mean it's

**[Speaker nan]**


[474.3 - 475.0] an interesting question.

**[Speaker nan]**


[477.1 - 481.5] On on I think the companies that have managed

**[Speaker nan]**


[480.5 - 483.1] as well. They're all.

**[Speaker nan]**


[484.1 - 487.6] All the companies now, I feel like are trying to do the right thing employee first

**[Speaker nan]**


[487.6 - 490.8] culture. Mm-hmm retaining Talent

**[Speaker nan]**


[490.8 - 494.0] retaining Talent biggest attracting Talent managing

**[Speaker nan]**


[493.3 - 495.0] your 409a.

**[Speaker nan]**


[495.5 - 497.4] I think stripe.

**[Speaker nan]**


[497.9 - 502.2] Did a really good job over time thinking about

**[Speaker nan]**


[502.2 - 505.4] that and then providing liquidity when

**[Speaker nan]**


[505.4 - 507.2] you know section annual tenders.

**[Speaker nan]**


[507.7 - 510.3] And they did those tenders actually at

**[Speaker nan]**


[510.3 - 513.7] the same valuation as the last round preferred, which

**[Speaker nan]**


[513.7 - 516.0] is very different that if you go back over time and look at

**[Speaker nan]**


[516.3 - 519.3] like uber and there was a 20% discount and so

**[Speaker nan]**


[519.3 - 522.4] they're actually valuing that common security at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[522.4 - 525.3] same as the preferred which is giving the employees a better deal than

**[Speaker nan]**


[525.3 - 525.7] they should get.

**[Speaker nan]**


[526.5 - 530.1] That I should when they should what could

**[Speaker nan]**


[529.1 - 532.5] they could? Yeah, I mean the reality is if

**[Speaker nan]**


[532.5 - 535.1] a preferred investor went around and turned so that security the next

**[Speaker nan]**


[535.1 - 536.5] day. It's very different than the common.

**[Speaker nan]**


[537.2 - 540.9] Yeah, and so I think I think they they're two

**[Speaker nan]**


[540.9 - 541.5] lessons out of that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[542.7 - 543.7] one of which is

**[Speaker nan]**


[544.6 - 547.0] that they took some of that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[548.1 - 551.5] liquidity pent-up liquidity demand out of

**[Speaker nan]**


[551.5 - 552.1] the stock

**[Speaker nan]**


[553.5 - 556.5] earlier, right? And then

**[Speaker nan]**


[556.5 - 559.8] the second piece is they treated

**[Speaker nan]**


[559.8 - 561.5] their employees in a way that

**[Speaker nan]**


[562.5 - 565.9] They didn't feel like it was unfair. Mm-hmm, even if

**[Speaker nan]**


[565.9 - 568.2] you know some sort

**[Speaker nan]**


[568.2 - 569.2] of discount is fair.

**[Speaker nan]**


[570.1 - 572.5] So I say on that side striped did the best job?

**[Speaker nan]**


[573.2 - 576.2] We would have said they used the wrong

**[Speaker nan]**


[576.2 - 579.6] approach that they that they should have looked at a structured Equity financing

**[Speaker nan]**


[579.6 - 582.4] given optionality. Mm-hmm. The employees would have

**[Speaker nan]**


[582.4 - 585.6] done better over time with that. But outside of

**[Speaker nan]**


[585.6 - 588.4] that I say, you know, they managed they got an

**[Speaker nan]**


[588.4 - 591.3] immediate or short-term immediate short term

**[Speaker nan]**


[591.3 - 594.3] benefit and the employees saw what they

**[Speaker nan]**


[594.3 - 597.6] were doing and was that clearly articulated to the employees that

**[Speaker nan]**


[597.6 - 600.2] Communications key Communications key and

**[Speaker nan]**


[600.2 - 603.6] all of that and I think the employee when you get down to price it's

**[Speaker nan]**


[603.6 - 603.9] really easy.

**[Speaker nan]**


[605.2 - 608.4] And and if there's a disparate price,

**[Speaker nan]**


[608.4 - 608.9] it's harder.

**[Speaker nan]**


[609.9 - 612.4] So speaking of you know Communications and

**[Speaker nan]**


[612.4 - 613.6] and educating

**[Speaker nan]**


[614.8 - 618.1] What about companies where they were anticipating an

**[Speaker nan]**


[617.1 - 620.6] IPO? Maybe not this year, but maybe the next

**[Speaker nan]**


[620.6 - 623.1] couple of years. How do you talk to

**[Speaker nan]**


[623.1 - 627.1] employees about their Equity about the 409a valuation?

**[Speaker nan]**


[626.1 - 629.3] What would you suggest telling them?

**[Speaker nan]**


[629.3 - 631.8] I mean it's hard right? I think.

**[Speaker nan]**


[632.9 - 635.7] The thing from The General Counsel see that

**[Speaker nan]**


[635.7 - 638.7] you all face and realizes when the

**[Speaker nan]**


[638.7 - 639.6] 49a goes up.

**[Speaker nan]**


[640.4 - 643.4] Everyone in the company thinks it's a good thing the value

**[Speaker nan]**


[643.4 - 646.8] of the company's going up and reality. It's just it's just

**[Speaker nan]**


[646.8 - 648.2] hurting them every time it does that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[649.2 - 652.3] And so I think the communication now.

**[Speaker nan]**


[653.4 - 657.4] which is the key is really looking at that

**[Speaker nan]**


[656.4 - 659.1] as an opportunity to go to the employees and

**[Speaker nan]**


[659.1 - 659.4] say

**[Speaker nan]**


[660.5 - 663.6] look you missed a window previously when the

**[Speaker nan]**


[663.6 - 664.4] 409a was lower.

**[Speaker nan]**


[665.2 - 668.4] This doesn't necessarily reflect the value of the company or

**[Speaker nan]**


[668.4 - 670.6] our opportunity. Obviously the markets changed.

**[Speaker nan]**


[671.2 - 674.5] The opportunities change, but now that the foreigners a is

**[Speaker nan]**


[674.5 - 678.0] down. This is an opportunity to change from

**[Speaker nan]**


[677.4 - 680.3] an option holder to shareholder. Mm-hmm. And

**[Speaker nan]**


[680.3 - 683.1] here's the reason why you do that and here's the benefit of

**[Speaker nan]**


[683.1 - 683.4] that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[684.1 - 687.5] And you know whether you

**[Speaker nan]**


[687.5 - 690.7] do that with your own money with your uncle's

**[Speaker nan]**


[690.7 - 693.9] money with third-party money. It's a

**[Speaker nan]**


[693.9 - 697.2] time to think about that. At least that's one message.

**[Speaker nan]**


[698.1 - 701.5] And then I think it has to be paired with the careful

**[Speaker nan]**


[701.5 - 701.9] plan.

**[Speaker nan]**


[703.1 - 703.8] in and around

**[Speaker nan]**


[705.6 - 707.5] the board and a re-up

**[Speaker nan]**


[708.3 - 712.1] of equity and that that re-up

**[Speaker nan]**


[711.1 - 714.2] is going to be interesting to see what people do you know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[714.2 - 717.3] is it going to be back to option

**[Speaker nan]**


[717.3 - 720.5] plans? Is it going to be RCS? Is it going to be a combination

**[Speaker nan]**


[720.5 - 723.6] but that decrease in 49a

**[Speaker nan]**


[723.6 - 726.0] gives that opportunity where you're now saying,

**[Speaker nan]**


[726.4 - 729.4] okay, we were able to bring our valuation down

**[Speaker nan]**


[729.4 - 732.3] because of Market comps we were able to bring

**[Speaker nan]**


[732.3 - 735.6] the valuation absolutely but and

**[Speaker nan]**


[735.6 - 738.6] that's that's for the CFOs in the room. You know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[738.6 - 742.0] that's what they're managing too. Yeah, and

**[Speaker nan]**


[741.2 - 744.0] it may be that the company's in a great

**[Speaker nan]**


[744.1 - 747.5] position and I think that's sort of the difference if you're in the GC

**[Speaker nan]**


[747.5 - 747.7] spot.

**[Speaker nan]**


[748.4 - 752.6] If you're in one of those companies that is doing terrific and

**[Speaker nan]**


[752.6 - 755.3] you feel like okay, we're still

**[Speaker nan]**


[755.3 - 758.2] going to win The Market opens. We're going to be able to get out

**[Speaker nan]**


[758.2 - 762.3] and we were able to get the 49a

**[Speaker nan]**


[761.3 - 764.9] down right gives the ability to exercise those

**[Speaker nan]**


[764.9 - 767.2] old options. It gives a ability to

**[Speaker nan]**


[767.2 - 770.5] reup in a new plan. Yeah, of course, the general counsel

**[Speaker nan]**


[770.5 - 773.9] needs to be careful to not be promising or

**[Speaker nan]**


[773.9 - 776.9] you know, giving any advice and

**[Speaker nan]**


[776.9 - 779.7] whether it's investment related or tax advice.

**[Speaker nan]**


[779.7 - 782.2] You don't want to be you know

**[Speaker nan]**


[782.2 - 782.9] talking about

**[Speaker nan]**


[784.1 - 788.0] the value that folks might get from their equation. Not

**[Speaker nan]**


[787.2 - 789.3] as the attorney. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[790.4 - 791.0] Yeah not.

**[Speaker nan]**


[792.2 - 796.0] That I didn't answer the back part of your question on who

**[Speaker nan]**


[795.4 - 796.9] hasn't done it well.

**[Speaker nan]**


[799.6 - 799.8] and

**[Speaker nan]**


[801.1 - 804.6] I'll give two examples. I think

**[Speaker nan]**


[804.6 - 808.4] Instagram is an interesting. So instacart

**[Speaker nan]**


[807.4 - 810.8] it's the car. Yeah Instagram and

**[Speaker nan]**


[810.8 - 813.3] right. Yes, that's situations.

**[Speaker nan]**


[814.2 - 815.5] Biopharma, yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[817.5 - 820.2] I don't know if people have followed the

**[Speaker nan]**


[820.2 - 823.4] instacart reports and the Wall Street Journal at

**[Speaker nan]**


[823.4 - 823.6] all, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[824.2 - 827.3] That's one that the jury

**[Speaker nan]**


[827.3 - 831.4] is a little bit out on what happens but at

**[Speaker nan]**


[830.4 - 833.5] least as reported by The Wall Street Journal.

**[Speaker nan]**


[834.1 - 837.7] They're actually going to go public solely to address this

**[Speaker nan]**


[837.7 - 838.1] issue.

**[Speaker nan]**


[838.7 - 840.9] And give the employees.

**[Speaker nan]**


[841.9 - 844.3] the ability to sell into the

**[Speaker nan]**


[844.3 - 846.0] IPO all the company's not

**[Speaker nan]**


[846.6 - 849.7] Well, that's what the Wall Street Journal says is the rationale.

**[Speaker nan]**


[849.7 - 853.1] Yeah employee the executives perhaps yeah

**[Speaker nan]**


[852.1 - 853.9] and

**[Speaker nan]**


[855.4 - 855.4] You know.

**[Speaker nan]**


[856.4 - 860.3] when I read that from the investors lens, the the

**[Speaker nan]**


[859.3 - 862.5] thing that was shocking to me was the concept

**[Speaker nan]**


[862.5 - 862.8] that

**[Speaker nan]**


[863.5 - 866.3] They're out on the Roadshow telling people to

**[Speaker nan]**


[866.3 - 869.3] go buy the shares and they're saying all the Insiders want to sell the

**[Speaker nan]**


[869.3 - 873.8] shares. Right? And and so unless

**[Speaker nan]**


[872.8 - 875.3] and this is the part you're

**[Speaker nan]**


[875.3 - 879.2] not in the room. And so I don't know the true story.

**[Speaker nan]**


[878.2 - 881.2] But unless they're saying hey look the

**[Speaker nan]**


[881.2 - 884.4] the executive team is is keeping 100% We're all

**[Speaker nan]**


[884.4 - 887.2] in but we have Engineers. We have people who've been here a long time

**[Speaker nan]**


[887.2 - 890.7] who need liquidity for different reasons. It just

**[Speaker nan]**


[890.7 - 893.4] seems like it's a different a different report. So it's

**[Speaker nan]**


[893.4 - 894.5] gonna be really interesting to see

**[Speaker nan]**


[895.6 - 898.7] That approach which is just where we're solving

**[Speaker nan]**


[898.7 - 903.2] this by going this combination of plans expiring validation

**[Speaker nan]**


[901.2 - 904.2] Talent retention and

**[Speaker nan]**


[904.2 - 907.8] we're just going to go public regardless of what that

**[Speaker nan]**


[907.8 - 911.2] means and what the street is going to say in terms

**[Speaker nan]**


[911.2 - 914.1] of whether they should be invested in that business. Yeah. What about

**[Speaker nan]**


[914.1 - 915.6] Airbnb? What's

**[Speaker nan]**


[916.6 - 917.4] your yeah, so I

**[Speaker nan]**


[918.4 - 918.7] I wasn't.

**[Speaker nan]**


[919.5 - 922.7] Directly involved in Airbnb so I

**[Speaker nan]**


[922.7 - 926.0] don't I don't really know my understanding of

**[Speaker nan]**


[925.2 - 928.6] that situation was again an

**[Speaker nan]**


[928.6 - 931.1] inspiring an RSU plan one was one of

**[Speaker nan]**


[931.1 - 931.5] the factors.

**[Speaker nan]**


[932.6 - 936.4] Why they went public at the time that they did? Yeah, and

**[Speaker nan]**


[935.4 - 937.2] I think the difference.

**[Speaker nan]**


[938.7 - 939.2] was

**[Speaker nan]**


[941.2 - 944.0] a recognition of that was one of the factors of

**[Speaker nan]**


[944.8 - 944.9] timing but

**[Speaker nan]**


[945.8 - 949.4] here all the reasons why the the company

**[Speaker nan]**


[949.4 - 952.2] deserves to be a public company today regardless of what's happening and

**[Speaker nan]**


[952.2 - 956.7] then the market grow environment, which is

**[Speaker nan]**


[956.7 - 959.4] I think a little different than Instagram's approach

**[Speaker nan]**


[959.4 - 960.9] instacart, okay?

**[Speaker nan]**


[962.3 - 963.5] I infected you.

**[Speaker nan]**


[969.3 - 969.7] So talk a little bit.

**[Speaker nan]**


[970.8 - 973.3] I guess I'll say the other thing I wouldn't

**[Speaker nan]**


[973.3 - 973.5] do.

**[Speaker nan]**


[974.6 - 977.5] And I take this because I know there's at least one GC in

**[Speaker nan]**


[977.5 - 978.1] the room who did it.

**[Speaker nan]**


[980.2 - 981.5] I wouldn't do company loan programs.

**[Speaker nan]**


[982.3 - 985.0] I'd say you know if you look at Lyme and

**[Speaker nan]**


[986.4 - 989.6] I'm sorry, right. Sometimes

**[Speaker nan]**


[989.6 - 992.8] you have to but that to

**[Speaker nan]**


[992.8 - 994.8] your question about for maybe one, you know, the

**[Speaker nan]**


[995.7 - 998.1] the gc's and the company generally.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1000.5 - 1002.7] Supporting the premise that we're going to do so great.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1003.8 - 1006.2] That you know, you should take loans from

**[Speaker nan]**


[1006.2 - 1009.3] us in order to do this and Loans themselves have

**[Speaker nan]**


[1009.3 - 1012.5] problems. They're tax inefficiencies, whether they're recourse

**[Speaker nan]**


[1012.5 - 1016.4] or non-recourse and that if you go way back to 2001 that's

**[Speaker nan]**


[1015.4 - 1017.1] a bunch of

**[Speaker nan]**


[1018.1 - 1022.4] a bunch of my clients and friends who took loans

**[Speaker nan]**


[1021.4 - 1024.8] and thought they

**[Speaker nan]**


[1024.8 - 1027.4] were fine because they were non-recourse but then got hit with

**[Speaker nan]**


[1027.4 - 1030.4] elimination and dentist income and had

**[Speaker nan]**


[1030.4 - 1034.2] to file bankruptcy. And so oh I know

**[Speaker nan]**


[1034.2 - 1034.6] a line

**[Speaker nan]**


[1035.4 - 1039.0] You know those executives are on the hook for you

**[Speaker nan]**


[1038.5 - 1041.2] know parts of those loans and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1041.2 - 1044.4] it's below the equity value. I don't

**[Speaker nan]**


[1044.4 - 1047.4] know the Vault story but D and good

**[Speaker nan]**


[1047.4 - 1050.5] dno insurance the board. I mean it brings

**[Speaker nan]**


[1050.5 - 1052.4] all those issues into play. There it is. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1054.6 - 1054.8] but

**[Speaker nan]**


[1055.9 - 1056.5] I think

**[Speaker nan]**


[1057.4 - 1060.0] I think some of that goes hand in hand where you really need to

**[Speaker nan]**


[1060.3 - 1061.1] be thoughtful about.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1062.3 - 1065.7] About what you're communicating to the employees what you're offering

**[Speaker nan]**


[1065.7 - 1068.6] whether you think about the company offering it

**[Speaker nan]**


[1068.6 - 1072.1] or you're you do it on a third party basis ultimately over

**[Speaker nan]**


[1071.1 - 1074.5] time. I think optionality for the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1074.5 - 1077.6] employees where they get to choose to maybe do

**[Speaker nan]**


[1077.6 - 1080.6] a traditional tender produce structured Equity Finance

**[Speaker nan]**


[1080.6 - 1083.6] or potentially take loans from the company. Like

**[Speaker nan]**


[1083.6 - 1086.4] all of that with technology is going to be really different in

**[Speaker nan]**


[1086.4 - 1087.4] the next three to five years.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1088.5 - 1091.2] And so I think a lot of that comes back

**[Speaker nan]**


[1091.2 - 1091.3] to

**[Speaker nan]**


[1092.2 - 1092.9] communication

**[Speaker nan]**


[1094.5 - 1097.8] and education and you know one thing Jennifer mentioned

**[Speaker nan]**


[1097.8 - 1100.9] was your compensation consultant and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1100.9 - 1103.7] I completely agree at recursion.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1103.7 - 1106.5] We use compensia, which has done a great job for

**[Speaker nan]**


[1106.5 - 1109.7] us. They will really help you, you know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[1109.7 - 1112.2] whichever consultant you use they will

**[Speaker nan]**


[1112.2 - 1115.6] help you think through these issues and then a company

**[Speaker nan]**


[1115.6 - 1119.7] like liquid stock as well. And then

**[Speaker nan]**


[1119.7 - 1122.4] of course your Brokers can assist in

**[Speaker nan]**


[1122.4 - 1122.7] this too.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1123.4 - 1125.2] and talk about because you're you're

**[Speaker nan]**


[1126.5 - 1129.7] communication obviously was very fast and positive.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1131.7 - 1131.8] but

**[Speaker nan]**


[1133.3 - 1133.3] you know.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1135.4 - 1138.3] Looking at it and saying okay if I had the benefit of all of the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1138.3 - 1138.5] time.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1139.7 - 1142.4] I mean one of the advantages for the gc's in the room is okay.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1142.4 - 1145.5] Now I can I can prep a strategy around

**[Speaker nan]**


[1145.5 - 1148.4] communication that's different. Like do you have advice for

**[Speaker nan]**


[1148.4 - 1149.0] the group on?

**[Speaker nan]**


[1149.9 - 1152.3] How you would think about that? Yeah, what you

**[Speaker nan]**


[1152.3 - 1155.7] did well in the short period of time what you would have done if you definitely

**[Speaker nan]**


[1155.7 - 1158.1] another day. Yes. Well, I mean one of

**[Speaker nan]**


[1158.1 - 1158.2] the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1159.3 - 1162.4] things you'll discover most likely is that the vast majority

**[Speaker nan]**


[1162.4 - 1165.7] of employees don't even think about their Equity until they

**[Speaker nan]**


[1165.7 - 1168.6] get close to IPO or to a

**[Speaker nan]**


[1168.6 - 1171.2] liquidity event. And so

**[Speaker nan]**


[1172.4 - 1175.1] if you're doing an IPO in a

**[Speaker nan]**


[1175.1 - 1178.4] short time frame, that's a you really need to raise the level

**[Speaker nan]**


[1178.4 - 1181.4] of understanding quickly and that was

**[Speaker nan]**


[1181.4 - 1185.2] a situation at recursion. So we had three sets

**[Speaker nan]**


[1184.2 - 1187.2] of trainings that we did and we offered them

**[Speaker nan]**


[1187.2 - 1190.3] repeatedly like Ad nauseam, so we

**[Speaker nan]**


[1190.3 - 1192.6] had a training that was an equity overview.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1193.3 - 1196.3] we had one on the insider trading policy that also

**[Speaker nan]**


[1196.3 - 1200.1] covered 10 b51 plans and then we were

**[Speaker nan]**


[1200.9 - 1203.5] Foolish enough, I would say to all

**[Speaker nan]**


[1203.5 - 1206.2] put an espp in place at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1206.2 - 1209.2] same time as the IPO. So we had a third training on

**[Speaker nan]**


[1209.2 - 1212.7] the Employee Stock purchase plan and we

**[Speaker nan]**


[1212.7 - 1215.5] made recordings of those trainings available. But we

**[Speaker nan]**


[1215.5 - 1219.5] we didn't have the slide decks available separately because

**[Speaker nan]**


[1218.5 - 1222.0] you do need the voice over particularly

**[Speaker nan]**


[1221.3 - 1224.9] with respect to the espp because

**[Speaker nan]**


[1224.9 - 1227.7] that's that's a prospectus. It

**[Speaker nan]**


[1227.7 - 1230.5] can be treated as an offering of stock. So you

**[Speaker nan]**


[1230.5 - 1233.1] need to make sure it's up to date and make sure

**[Speaker nan]**


[1233.1 - 1236.7] you have all of the information being delivered at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1236.7 - 1239.6] same time. So be careful in general with what

**[Speaker nan]**


[1239.6 - 1243.7] you distribute in hard copy and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1242.7 - 1245.9] you can do presentations

**[Speaker nan]**


[1245.9 - 1248.9] by Zoom. They don't need to be in person but be

**[Speaker nan]**


[1248.9 - 1252.1] prepared for a lot of questioning. It

**[Speaker nan]**


[1251.1 - 1254.5] does depend on your employee base how large

**[Speaker nan]**


[1254.5 - 1257.3] a company of course whether you're Global but also

**[Speaker nan]**


[1257.3 - 1259.8] the company culture really makes a difference.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1260.9 - 1263.7] Recursion we had a very transparent culture

**[Speaker nan]**


[1263.7 - 1266.2] free IPO and we

**[Speaker nan]**


[1266.2 - 1269.9] also have an endlessly curious and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1269.9 - 1272.1] questioning and you know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[1272.1 - 1275.5] very intelligent employee base. And so they would just

**[Speaker nan]**


[1275.5 - 1278.3] pepper us with questions. And at one point

**[Speaker nan]**


[1278.3 - 1282.6] I considered preparing an FAQ document because

**[Speaker nan]**


[1281.6 - 1284.9] some of the questions would occur and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1284.9 - 1287.2] you know, you're saying the same things over and over

**[Speaker nan]**


[1287.2 - 1289.9] but there's a real downside to having

**[Speaker nan]**


[1290.6 - 1293.4] You know any kind of information in writing other

**[Speaker nan]**


[1293.4 - 1296.7] than the actual insider trading policy and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1296.7 - 1299.3] the scrubbed deck that is

**[Speaker nan]**


[1299.3 - 1303.9] the equity overview. So ultimately we didn't have FAQs

**[Speaker nan]**


[1302.9 - 1304.7] that we prepared.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1307.2 - 1310.7] But we also had asked me anything sessions in

**[Speaker nan]**


[1310.7 - 1313.4] addition to the three categories of training that

**[Speaker nan]**


[1313.4 - 1316.1] I mentioned and there are people could have more

**[Speaker nan]**


[1316.1 - 1319.0] one-on-one attention and obviously as I said

**[Speaker nan]**


[1319.3 - 1322.6] before you can't be giving people investment or tax advice, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[1323.5 - 1327.9] Some folks need that personal attention. The stock

**[Speaker nan]**


[1327.9 - 1330.5] administrator is absolutely critical

**[Speaker nan]**


[1330.5 - 1333.3] in this regard. I really recommend having your

**[Speaker nan]**


[1333.3 - 1339.1] stock administrator hired pre-ipo hire

**[Speaker nan]**


[1337.1 - 1340.0] someone with a ton of

**[Speaker nan]**


[1340.9 - 1343.6] experience if possible. They will save

**[Speaker nan]**


[1343.6 - 1347.5] you they will help with this education and the communication and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1346.5 - 1349.4] they're able to hold people's hands

**[Speaker nan]**


[1349.4 - 1352.4] in a way that you will not have the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1352.4 - 1356.2] time to do and also the distribution of information. It's

**[Speaker nan]**


[1355.2 - 1358.0] a great spot. If you decide you're going to

**[Speaker nan]**


[1358.2 - 1361.4] put out pieces and when we work with companies, we actually

**[Speaker nan]**


[1361.4 - 1365.2] do because we feel like you got to educate them. Yeah, providing

**[Speaker nan]**


[1364.2 - 1367.5] Financial or tax advice, but you can you can

**[Speaker nan]**


[1367.5 - 1368.0] simplify.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1368.9 - 1371.5] A lot of complicated things for them and then

**[Speaker nan]**


[1371.5 - 1374.2] you can refer them off to wherever you firm, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[1374.2 - 1377.2] the stock administrators portals or the employees

**[Speaker nan]**


[1377.2 - 1380.5] go and they're looking at all their information. They also

**[Speaker nan]**


[1380.5 - 1384.1] at least one who's in the room share works

**[Speaker nan]**


[1383.1 - 1386.1] and I think Carter has

**[Speaker nan]**


[1386.1 - 1389.2] it as well. All of that is is a great spot to

**[Speaker nan]**


[1389.2 - 1392.1] be the repository for that information. So you

**[Speaker nan]**


[1392.1 - 1395.8] make sure everyone's getting the same information. It's been blessed

**[Speaker nan]**


[1395.8 - 1398.3] by legal. It's been blessed by around in tax. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1398.3 - 1401.4] Yeah and your broker will be really helpful from

**[Speaker nan]**


[1401.4 - 1404.5] an education perspective. You know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[1404.5 - 1407.0] when when you asked part of your

**[Speaker nan]**


[1407.3 - 1410.2] question was what would I do differently? Yeah. Yeah, one of the things

**[Speaker nan]**


[1410.2 - 1414.1] I think I would do differently is engage much

**[Speaker nan]**


[1413.1 - 1416.8] more with the broker. We didn't have much

**[Speaker nan]**


[1416.8 - 1420.4] time, you know to get things done. But ultimately we

**[Speaker nan]**


[1420.4 - 1424.4] went with Fidelity which has amazing educational materials

**[Speaker nan]**


[1423.4 - 1426.5] available on its website and they

**[Speaker nan]**


[1426.5 - 1428.8] also offer personal advisors.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1429.2 - 1432.9] We chose the option that everyone in the company could

**[Speaker nan]**


[1432.9 - 1436.5] have their own advisor not just Executives and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1435.5 - 1438.8] they that's a

**[Speaker nan]**


[1438.8 - 1441.9] great resource for folks. I also

**[Speaker nan]**


[1441.9 - 1446.0] would have hired our stock administrator sooner that

**[Speaker nan]**


[1444.5 - 1447.5] individual was hired right

**[Speaker nan]**


[1447.5 - 1450.7] around the same time. I was so three months into our

**[Speaker nan]**


[1450.7 - 1453.6] four months of Ikea preparation.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1453.6 - 1456.6] So we were both learning the company and you

**[Speaker nan]**


[1456.6 - 1459.8] know learning the employee base

**[Speaker nan]**


[1459.8 - 1462.1] at the same time and I

**[Speaker nan]**


[1462.1 - 1465.3] also would wait longer to put an espp in place. You

**[Speaker nan]**


[1465.3 - 1468.0] don't need to rush to do that that could have waited.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1468.8 - 1472.0] For a year, I mean there was liquidity from the IPO.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1471.2 - 1474.5] So there was no great need for

**[Speaker nan]**


[1474.5 - 1479.0] it. But we're very ambitious company and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1477.2 - 1480.2] I certainly were just looking

**[Speaker nan]**


[1480.2 - 1483.6] at that as another perk. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was partly that

**[Speaker nan]**


[1483.6 - 1486.4] Talent retention aspect. Yeah, so we

**[Speaker nan]**


[1486.4 - 1489.7] have 15% discount with the espp that

**[Speaker nan]**


[1489.7 - 1491.5] we put in place and

**[Speaker nan]**


[1493.2 - 1496.4] While that was a big lift from an education

**[Speaker nan]**


[1496.4 - 1499.7] standpoint, I think it was also really attractive for our

**[Speaker nan]**


[1499.7 - 1502.3] employees. Yeah, and I hadn't thought

**[Speaker nan]**


[1502.3 - 1505.2] about it until now but it would be interesting to see

**[Speaker nan]**


[1505.2 - 1508.4] if that comes back into the you know, because you have you have

**[Speaker nan]**


[1508.4 - 1510.9] Now options versus rsues people.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1511.6 - 1515.9] Scared of the RSU plans and what's happening and the

**[Speaker nan]**


[1514.9 - 1517.0] reasons why they're not going to

**[Speaker nan]**


[1517.1 - 1518.4] go the option plan route. So

**[Speaker nan]**


[1520.3 - 1524.7] I'll be interesting. Mm-hmm. So any other parting wisdom?

**[Speaker nan]**


[1523.7 - 1526.2] Yeah, we only

**[Speaker nan]**


[1526.2 - 1529.5] have a couple minutes left but I would say with respect to

**[Speaker nan]**


[1529.5 - 1532.6] 10b51 plans. They're if you're

**[Speaker nan]**


[1532.6 - 1535.1] at a smaller company, they're going to be a

**[Speaker nan]**


[1535.1 - 1538.4] bit of a bear to handle and this is a place where the stock

**[Speaker nan]**


[1538.4 - 1540.4] administrator can come in really helpful, too.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1542.9 - 1545.1] If you have a company with the level of

**[Speaker nan]**


[1545.1 - 1548.3] transparency that I mentioned then you'll have way more people

**[Speaker nan]**


[1548.3 - 1551.9] who need or arguably, you know should have 10

**[Speaker nan]**


[1551.9 - 1554.6] B, five one plans then at another type

**[Speaker nan]**


[1554.6 - 1557.4] of company and it can

**[Speaker nan]**


[1557.4 - 1560.3] scare your broker initially Fidelity told us

**[Speaker nan]**


[1560.3 - 1563.2] we couldn't have that many people with tend to be

**[Speaker nan]**


[1563.2 - 1566.5] five one plans because they were used to only section 16

**[Speaker nan]**


[1566.5 - 1569.5] officers and directors and the like having those

**[Speaker nan]**


[1569.5 - 1572.2] plans and our company we had about 50 people

**[Speaker nan]**


[1572.2 - 1575.8] with Tempe 51 plus which is a lot especially

**[Speaker nan]**


[1575.8 - 1578.4] as you know, Ebola like all

**[Speaker nan]**


[1578.4 - 1579.0] at one time.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1580.9 - 1581.3] but

**[Speaker nan]**


[1582.2 - 1585.9] The alternative if folks don't want to attend b51 plan

**[Speaker nan]**


[1585.9 - 1588.8] is you put many people on a pre-clearance

**[Speaker nan]**


[1588.8 - 1591.5] list. And so your stock administrator is

**[Speaker nan]**


[1591.5 - 1594.0] going to be really helpful for you in kind of

**[Speaker nan]**


[1594.6 - 1597.2] administering the pre-clearance list as well.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1597.2 - 1601.1] You need a checklist for pre-clearance and you

**[Speaker nan]**


[1600.1 - 1603.6] know, the admin can prepare much of

**[Speaker nan]**


[1603.6 - 1606.8] that and then you as compliance officer

**[Speaker nan]**


[1606.8 - 1610.6] essentially will be validating that they

**[Speaker nan]**


[1609.6 - 1612.6] are pre-cleared to trade but

**[Speaker nan]**


[1612.6 - 1615.4] it's a constant flow either of 10

**[Speaker nan]**


[1615.4 - 1618.7] B5 one plan review Drafting and review or

**[Speaker nan]**


[1618.7 - 1620.3] of the pretty clearance.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1621.7 - 1622.6] Thank you. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[1624.8 - 1626.7] I think that's that's all we have time for.
