**[Speaker nan]**


[00:00 - 00:05] Hi everyone.

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:05 - 00:08] I'm Louisa Daniels general counsel

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:08 - 00:10] for recursion Pharmaceuticals.

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:11 - 00:16] I joined recursion halfway through

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:16 - 00:19] the IPO preparation stage. I

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:19 - 00:22] would say or or probably three quarters of the way through

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:22 - 00:25] and that was in January of 2021. We

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:25 - 00:29] went public in on April 15th 2021.

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:28 - 00:31] So we just made it before in

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:31 - 00:34] the market completely changed had a

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:34 - 00:38] very big IPO, but we did it very very fast and

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:37 - 00:41] recursion is part of

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:41 - 00:44] the new wave of tech enabled drug Discovery companies.

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:44 - 00:47] We have an AI machine learning platform

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:47 - 00:50] that we use with image-based

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:50 - 00:53] processing to develop essentially maps

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:53 - 00:57] of human biology, and we now have four compounds

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:56 - 00:59] in the clinic. So we're

**[Speaker nan]**


[00:59 - 01:02] judged as a biopharma company as well.

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:02 - 01:05] I'll leave it at that deaf. You

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:05 - 01:08] can introduce yourself and I'm Jeff lassage. I'm

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:08 - 01:11] one of the founders of liquid stock we

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:11 - 01:15] Provide structured Equity financing to free IPO

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:15 - 01:18] companies. It's really a hybrid between a loan and

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:18 - 01:18] a sale.

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:19 - 01:22] And we wanted Luisa here to make all

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:22 - 01:23] the general counsels. Who are

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:24 - 01:27] Facing all the pressure be really jealous of someone who

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:27 - 01:30] got through her process of three months. I don't

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:30 - 01:33] think I don't think you should be jealous. It was

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:33 - 01:34] very very hard.

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:35 - 01:38] You know, we we took about

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:38 - 01:41] four months to do all of the preparation drafting

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:41 - 01:44] ES1. I mean you name it. It was

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:44 - 01:47] incredibly fast everything we do at recursion.

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:47 - 01:50] We do fast to a very high standard as well, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:50 - 01:54] I don't recommend it. So don't be don't be jealous. Actually.

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:53 - 01:57] The silver lining of current macroeconomic

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:56 - 01:59] conditions is that you do have a lot of time to

**[Speaker nan]**


[01:59 - 02:05] prepare for your IPO. Yeah times

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:04 - 02:07] times in this year. Yeah in both

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:07 - 02:08] directions. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:08 - 02:12] So, you know given the state

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:11 - 02:14] of the market right now Jeff

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:14 - 02:18] with the IPO window essentially closed

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:17 - 02:20] and no certainty on

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:20 - 02:24] when it may reopen. How do you how do you think IPO preparation

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:24 - 02:27] should be handled in terms of equity so from

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:27 - 02:30] that perspective and also just

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:30 - 02:33] to back up a little bit. I was also a partner Gibson done

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:33 - 02:36] where I practice Securities m&a venture capital

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:36 - 02:39] for 15 years. I've seen it. I've been through

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:39 - 02:43] both sides now both sides. So I saw 2001 2008

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:45 - 02:45] I would say.

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:46 - 02:49] From and we're dealing with a bunch of the private

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:49 - 02:51] company GCS now.

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:52 - 02:55] In in my time. There's never been a

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:55 - 02:58] more stressful time on the GC because of

**[Speaker nan]**


[02:58 - 03:02] that time and what's happening and you

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:01 - 03:05] see it in the news, but you have plans expiring

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:04 - 03:07] RSU plans in

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:07 - 03:07] particular.

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:08 - 03:12] So you have this combination of pressure from the c-suite

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:11 - 03:14] and the board not understanding.

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:15 - 03:18] the ramifications in particular the massive accounting

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:18 - 03:19] charges

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:19 - 03:22] Are potentially coming depending on how you

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:22 - 03:25] maneuver and then

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:25 - 03:29] you have the pressure of all of the employees and the

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:29 - 03:33] combination of of those as is is the

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:32 - 03:35] job of the GC now to

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:35 - 03:37] juggle and often if they were in the seat.

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:38 - 03:41] At the point time when the plans were adopted they're getting blamed.

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:42 - 03:45] For what what's you know the state of where the

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:45 - 03:45] company is?

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:46 - 03:49] But don't don't get too depressed by that we're going to

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:49 - 03:52] talk about we know accents that you can take and how to handle

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:52 - 03:55] that. But one thing that would be helpful. I think what do

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:55 - 03:59] you think if we take a poll of what staged

**[Speaker nan]**


[03:58 - 04:01] companies are at in the room right now?

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:01 - 04:05] So for example Angel to series

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:04 - 04:07] B's or anyone in the room whose companies

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:07 - 04:09] is at that stage.

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:11 - 04:14] Okay and see through

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:14 - 04:15] e

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:16 - 04:19] oh a lot of folks. Okay, that's really helpful to

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:19 - 04:23] know and how about people who

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:23 - 04:26] thought their companies would have been public by now already?

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:27 - 04:30] Not that many. Okay. So the sweet

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:30 - 04:34] spot is kind of series see through e so that's helpful. And another

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:33 - 04:36] thing we wanted to mention. If you have any

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:36 - 04:39] questions, feel free to raise your hand during the

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:39 - 04:43] discussion. You don't need to wait to the end and don't

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:43 - 04:46] feel shy about asking anything that

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:46 - 04:47] comes to mind.

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:49 - 04:52] so you talked about amending RSU plans

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:52 - 04:52] and

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:54 - 04:58] You know the drop-in Valley valuations, there's

**[Speaker nan]**


[04:57 - 05:00] a big debate on you know, sort of taking a second

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:00 - 05:03] bite of the Apple amending a plan for the second

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:03 - 05:06] time. Can you explain a little

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:06 - 05:10] more about why that's a big deal. You talked about accounting implications.

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:09 - 05:12] How are the companies

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:12 - 05:14] that you're working with handling this issue?

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:15 - 05:17] Yeah for all of you who are sort of in that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:18 - 05:22] sea that e range depending on the timing at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:21 - 05:24] my biggest takeaway now is to go out and read

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:24 - 05:27] all your plans because you may not know it but

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:27 - 05:30] but that plan expiration is gonna be coming

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:30 - 05:33] and it doesn't

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:33 - 05:34] look like that Windows going to be

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:35 - 05:38] Opening up for a lot of companies for some time

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:38 - 05:41] what what that

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:41 - 05:45] means varies? And so that

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:44 - 05:48] first what what we

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:47 - 05:50] saw references that first bite of the apple is

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:50 - 05:53] amending the RSU plan one

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:53 - 05:56] time typically is viewed is not causing

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:56 - 05:59] the IRS to look at that plan and say well

**[Speaker nan]**


[05:59 - 06:02] we think there's no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture.

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:03 - 06:07] and so you're allowing some segment of that RSU

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:06 - 06:10] class to actually accelerate convert

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:09 - 06:12] those rsues into shares and potentially

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:12 - 06:15] give them a liquidity event, whether that's thirst, you

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:15 - 06:17] know, a structured Equity Finance or

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:17 - 06:21] Through a tender offer. And so

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:21 - 06:24] then the the question comes if you've done that

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:24 - 06:24] once.

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:25 - 06:28] Can you do it again? And and I

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:28 - 06:28] think

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:30 - 06:33] most of the lawyers who are advising

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:33 - 06:36] the companies in the room and they accountants and tax

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:36 - 06:38] advisors are saying you cannot.

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:39 - 06:41] It's interesting to look now, though.

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:42 - 06:45] At this time and think about how long a time

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:45 - 06:48] period we potentially have to see

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:48 - 06:51] whether or not people are going to take a different position

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:51 - 06:54] on that now, but the main thing is

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:54 - 06:55] if you're RC plan goes away.

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:56 - 07:00] You've got a bunch of questions. You've got to answer and

**[Speaker nan]**


[06:59 - 07:02] on the top of the list is okay. What's

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:02 - 07:05] the accounting charge to re-up all of

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:05 - 07:08] your existing employees and oftentimes, that's

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:08 - 07:09] a massive hit.

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:10 - 07:13] Because those the value of of those rsues is

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:13 - 07:16] grown tremendously over time. Maybe it's come down. So but even

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:16 - 07:19] in that in that view at the time, you're CFO

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:19 - 07:22] is trying to keep your balance sheet pristine and one

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:22 - 07:25] of the room. Yeah, so you need to also keep in

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:25 - 07:28] mind how much pressure is coming from the employees for

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:28 - 07:30] liquidity event.

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:31 - 07:34] That depends on how large your employee bases how long

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:34 - 07:35] they've been with the company.

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:37 - 07:40] You know how much the valuation has changed. So

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:40 - 07:43] one thing I'm curious about is had what companies

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:43 - 07:46] do you think have done this? Well, how many you know

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:46 - 07:49] who has done it poorly on who is maybe in a

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:49 - 07:50] sort of waiting?

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:51 - 07:54] Waiting stage. I mean it's

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:54 - 07:55] an interesting question.

**[Speaker nan]**


[07:57 - 08:01] On on I think the companies that have managed

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:00 - 08:03] as well. They're all.

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:04 - 08:07] All the companies now, I feel like are trying to do the right thing employee first

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:07 - 08:10] culture. Mm-hmm retaining Talent

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:10 - 08:14] retaining Talent biggest attracting Talent managing

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:13 - 08:15] your 409a.

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:15 - 08:17] I think stripe.

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:17 - 08:22] Did a really good job over time thinking about

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:22 - 08:25] that and then providing liquidity when

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:25 - 08:27] you know section annual tenders.

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:27 - 08:30] And they did those tenders actually at

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:30 - 08:33] the same valuation as the last round preferred, which

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:33 - 08:36] is very different that if you go back over time and look at

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:36 - 08:39] like uber and there was a 20% discount and so

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:39 - 08:42] they're actually valuing that common security at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:42 - 08:45] same as the preferred which is giving the employees a better deal than

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:45 - 08:45] they should get.

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:46 - 08:50] That I should when they should what could

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:49 - 08:52] they could? Yeah, I mean the reality is if

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:52 - 08:55] a preferred investor went around and turned so that security the next

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:55 - 08:56] day. It's very different than the common.

**[Speaker nan]**


[08:57 - 09:00] Yeah, and so I think I think they they're two

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:00 - 09:01] lessons out of that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:02 - 09:03] one of which is

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:04 - 09:07] that they took some of that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:08 - 09:11] liquidity pent-up liquidity demand out of

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:11 - 09:12] the stock

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:13 - 09:16] earlier, right? And then

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:16 - 09:19] the second piece is they treated

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:19 - 09:21] their employees in a way that

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:22 - 09:25] They didn't feel like it was unfair. Mm-hmm, even if

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:25 - 09:28] you know some sort

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:28 - 09:29] of discount is fair.

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:30 - 09:32] So I say on that side striped did the best job?

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:33 - 09:36] We would have said they used the wrong

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:36 - 09:39] approach that they that they should have looked at a structured Equity financing

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:39 - 09:42] given optionality. Mm-hmm. The employees would have

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:42 - 09:45] done better over time with that. But outside of

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:45 - 09:48] that I say, you know, they managed they got an

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:48 - 09:51] immediate or short-term immediate short term

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:51 - 09:54] benefit and the employees saw what they

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:54 - 09:57] were doing and was that clearly articulated to the employees that

**[Speaker nan]**


[09:57 - 10:00] Communications key Communications key and

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:00 - 10:03] all of that and I think the employee when you get down to price it's

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:03 - 10:03] really easy.

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:05 - 10:08] And and if there's a disparate price,

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:08 - 10:08] it's harder.

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:09 - 10:12] So speaking of you know Communications and

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:12 - 10:13] and educating

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:14 - 10:18] What about companies where they were anticipating an

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:17 - 10:20] IPO? Maybe not this year, but maybe the next

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:20 - 10:23] couple of years. How do you talk to

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:23 - 10:27] employees about their Equity about the 409a valuation?

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:26 - 10:29] What would you suggest telling them?

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:29 - 10:31] I mean it's hard right? I think.

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:32 - 10:35] The thing from The General Counsel see that

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:35 - 10:38] you all face and realizes when the

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:38 - 10:39] 49a goes up.

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:40 - 10:43] Everyone in the company thinks it's a good thing the value

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:43 - 10:46] of the company's going up and reality. It's just it's just

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:46 - 10:48] hurting them every time it does that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:49 - 10:52] And so I think the communication now.

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:53 - 10:57] which is the key is really looking at that

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:56 - 10:59] as an opportunity to go to the employees and

**[Speaker nan]**


[10:59 - 10:59] say

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:00 - 11:03] look you missed a window previously when the

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:03 - 11:04] 409a was lower.

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:05 - 11:08] This doesn't necessarily reflect the value of the company or

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:08 - 11:10] our opportunity. Obviously the markets changed.

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:11 - 11:14] The opportunities change, but now that the foreigners a is

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:14 - 11:18] down. This is an opportunity to change from

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:17 - 11:20] an option holder to shareholder. Mm-hmm. And

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:20 - 11:23] here's the reason why you do that and here's the benefit of

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:23 - 11:23] that.

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:24 - 11:27] And you know whether you

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:27 - 11:30] do that with your own money with your uncle's

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:30 - 11:33] money with third-party money. It's a

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:33 - 11:37] time to think about that. At least that's one message.

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:38 - 11:41] And then I think it has to be paired with the careful

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:41 - 11:41] plan.

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:43 - 11:43] in and around

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:45 - 11:47] the board and a re-up

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:48 - 11:52] of equity and that that re-up

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:51 - 11:54] is going to be interesting to see what people do you know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:54 - 11:57] is it going to be back to option

**[Speaker nan]**


[11:57 - 12:00] plans? Is it going to be RCS? Is it going to be a combination

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:00 - 12:03] but that decrease in 49a

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:03 - 12:06] gives that opportunity where you're now saying,

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:06 - 12:09] okay, we were able to bring our valuation down

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:09 - 12:12] because of Market comps we were able to bring

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:12 - 12:15] the valuation absolutely but and

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:15 - 12:18] that's that's for the CFOs in the room. You know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:18 - 12:22] that's what they're managing too. Yeah, and

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:21 - 12:24] it may be that the company's in a great

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:24 - 12:27] position and I think that's sort of the difference if you're in the GC

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:27 - 12:27] spot.

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:28 - 12:32] If you're in one of those companies that is doing terrific and

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:32 - 12:35] you feel like okay, we're still

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:35 - 12:38] going to win The Market opens. We're going to be able to get out

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:38 - 12:42] and we were able to get the 49a

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:41 - 12:44] down right gives the ability to exercise those

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:44 - 12:47] old options. It gives a ability to

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:47 - 12:50] reup in a new plan. Yeah, of course, the general counsel

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:50 - 12:53] needs to be careful to not be promising or

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:53 - 12:56] you know, giving any advice and

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:56 - 12:59] whether it's investment related or tax advice.

**[Speaker nan]**


[12:59 - 13:02] You don't want to be you know

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:02 - 13:02] talking about

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:04 - 13:08] the value that folks might get from their equation. Not

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:07 - 13:09] as the attorney. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:10 - 13:11] Yeah not.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:12 - 13:16] That I didn't answer the back part of your question on who

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:15 - 13:16] hasn't done it well.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:19 - 13:19] and

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:21 - 13:24] I'll give two examples. I think

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:24 - 13:28] Instagram is an interesting. So instacart

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:27 - 13:30] it's the car. Yeah Instagram and

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:30 - 13:33] right. Yes, that's situations.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:34 - 13:35] Biopharma, yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:37 - 13:40] I don't know if people have followed the

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:40 - 13:43] instacart reports and the Wall Street Journal at

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:43 - 13:43] all, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:44 - 13:47] That's one that the jury

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:47 - 13:51] is a little bit out on what happens but at

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:50 - 13:53] least as reported by The Wall Street Journal.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:54 - 13:57] They're actually going to go public solely to address this

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:57 - 13:58] issue.

**[Speaker nan]**


[13:58 - 14:00] And give the employees.

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:01 - 14:04] the ability to sell into the

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:04 - 14:06] IPO all the company's not

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:06 - 14:09] Well, that's what the Wall Street Journal says is the rationale.

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:09 - 14:13] Yeah employee the executives perhaps yeah

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:12 - 14:13] and

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:15 - 14:15] You know.

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:16 - 14:20] when I read that from the investors lens, the the

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:19 - 14:22] thing that was shocking to me was the concept

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:22 - 14:22] that

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:23 - 14:26] They're out on the Roadshow telling people to

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:26 - 14:29] go buy the shares and they're saying all the Insiders want to sell the

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:29 - 14:33] shares. Right? And and so unless

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:32 - 14:35] and this is the part you're

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:35 - 14:39] not in the room. And so I don't know the true story.

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:38 - 14:41] But unless they're saying hey look the

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:41 - 14:44] the executive team is is keeping 100% We're all

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:44 - 14:47] in but we have Engineers. We have people who've been here a long time

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:47 - 14:50] who need liquidity for different reasons. It just

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:50 - 14:53] seems like it's a different a different report. So it's

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:53 - 14:54] gonna be really interesting to see

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:55 - 14:58] That approach which is just where we're solving

**[Speaker nan]**


[14:58 - 15:03] this by going this combination of plans expiring validation

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:01 - 15:04] Talent retention and

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:04 - 15:07] we're just going to go public regardless of what that

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:07 - 15:11] means and what the street is going to say in terms

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:11 - 15:14] of whether they should be invested in that business. Yeah. What about

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:14 - 15:15] Airbnb? What's

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:16 - 15:17] your yeah, so I

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:18 - 15:18] I wasn't.

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:19 - 15:22] Directly involved in Airbnb so I

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:22 - 15:26] don't I don't really know my understanding of

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:25 - 15:28] that situation was again an

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:28 - 15:31] inspiring an RSU plan one was one of

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:31 - 15:31] the factors.

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:32 - 15:36] Why they went public at the time that they did? Yeah, and

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:35 - 15:37] I think the difference.

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:38 - 15:39] was

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:41 - 15:44] a recognition of that was one of the factors of

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:44 - 15:44] timing but

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:45 - 15:49] here all the reasons why the the company

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:49 - 15:52] deserves to be a public company today regardless of what's happening and

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:52 - 15:56] then the market grow environment, which is

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:56 - 15:59] I think a little different than Instagram's approach

**[Speaker nan]**


[15:59 - 16:00] instacart, okay?

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:02 - 16:03] I infected you.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:09 - 16:09] So talk a little bit.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:10 - 16:13] I guess I'll say the other thing I wouldn't

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:13 - 16:13] do.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:14 - 16:17] And I take this because I know there's at least one GC in

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:17 - 16:18] the room who did it.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:20 - 16:21] I wouldn't do company loan programs.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:22 - 16:25] I'd say you know if you look at Lyme and

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:26 - 16:29] I'm sorry, right. Sometimes

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:29 - 16:32] you have to but that to

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:32 - 16:34] your question about for maybe one, you know, the

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:35 - 16:38] the gc's and the company generally.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:40 - 16:42] Supporting the premise that we're going to do so great.

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:43 - 16:46] That you know, you should take loans from

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:46 - 16:49] us in order to do this and Loans themselves have

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:49 - 16:52] problems. They're tax inefficiencies, whether they're recourse

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:52 - 16:56] or non-recourse and that if you go way back to 2001 that's

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:55 - 16:57] a bunch of

**[Speaker nan]**


[16:58 - 17:02] a bunch of my clients and friends who took loans

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:01 - 17:04] and thought they

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:04 - 17:07] were fine because they were non-recourse but then got hit with

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:07 - 17:10] elimination and dentist income and had

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:10 - 17:14] to file bankruptcy. And so oh I know

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:14 - 17:14] a line

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:15 - 17:19] You know those executives are on the hook for you

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:18 - 17:21] know parts of those loans and

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:21 - 17:24] it's below the equity value. I don't

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:24 - 17:27] know the Vault story but D and good

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:27 - 17:30] dno insurance the board. I mean it brings

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:30 - 17:32] all those issues into play. There it is. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:34 - 17:34] but

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:35 - 17:36] I think

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:37 - 17:40] I think some of that goes hand in hand where you really need to

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:40 - 17:41] be thoughtful about.

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:42 - 17:45] About what you're communicating to the employees what you're offering

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:45 - 17:48] whether you think about the company offering it

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:48 - 17:52] or you're you do it on a third party basis ultimately over

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:51 - 17:54] time. I think optionality for the

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:54 - 17:57] employees where they get to choose to maybe do

**[Speaker nan]**


[17:57 - 18:00] a traditional tender produce structured Equity Finance

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:00 - 18:03] or potentially take loans from the company. Like

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:03 - 18:06] all of that with technology is going to be really different in

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:06 - 18:07] the next three to five years.

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:08 - 18:11] And so I think a lot of that comes back

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:11 - 18:11] to

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:12 - 18:12] communication

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:14 - 18:17] and education and you know one thing Jennifer mentioned

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:17 - 18:20] was your compensation consultant and

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:20 - 18:23] I completely agree at recursion.

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:23 - 18:26] We use compensia, which has done a great job for

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:26 - 18:29] us. They will really help you, you know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:29 - 18:32] whichever consultant you use they will

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:32 - 18:35] help you think through these issues and then a company

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:35 - 18:39] like liquid stock as well. And then

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:39 - 18:42] of course your Brokers can assist in

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:42 - 18:42] this too.

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:43 - 18:45] and talk about because you're you're

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:46 - 18:49] communication obviously was very fast and positive.

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:51 - 18:51] but

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:53 - 18:53] you know.

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:55 - 18:58] Looking at it and saying okay if I had the benefit of all of the

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:58 - 18:58] time.

**[Speaker nan]**


[18:59 - 19:02] I mean one of the advantages for the gc's in the room is okay.

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:02 - 19:05] Now I can I can prep a strategy around

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:05 - 19:08] communication that's different. Like do you have advice for

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:08 - 19:09] the group on?

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:09 - 19:12] How you would think about that? Yeah, what you

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:12 - 19:15] did well in the short period of time what you would have done if you definitely

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:15 - 19:18] another day. Yes. Well, I mean one of

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:18 - 19:18] the

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:19 - 19:22] things you'll discover most likely is that the vast majority

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:22 - 19:25] of employees don't even think about their Equity until they

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:25 - 19:28] get close to IPO or to a

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:28 - 19:31] liquidity event. And so

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:32 - 19:35] if you're doing an IPO in a

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:35 - 19:38] short time frame, that's a you really need to raise the level

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:38 - 19:41] of understanding quickly and that was

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:41 - 19:45] a situation at recursion. So we had three sets

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:44 - 19:47] of trainings that we did and we offered them

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:47 - 19:50] repeatedly like Ad nauseam, so we

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:50 - 19:52] had a training that was an equity overview.

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:53 - 19:56] we had one on the insider trading policy that also

**[Speaker nan]**


[19:56 - 20:00] covered 10 b51 plans and then we were

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:00 - 20:03] Foolish enough, I would say to all

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:03 - 20:06] put an espp in place at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:06 - 20:09] same time as the IPO. So we had a third training on

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:09 - 20:12] the Employee Stock purchase plan and we

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:12 - 20:15] made recordings of those trainings available. But we

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:15 - 20:19] we didn't have the slide decks available separately because

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:18 - 20:22] you do need the voice over particularly

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:21 - 20:24] with respect to the espp because

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:24 - 20:27] that's that's a prospectus. It

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:27 - 20:30] can be treated as an offering of stock. So you

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:30 - 20:33] need to make sure it's up to date and make sure

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:33 - 20:36] you have all of the information being delivered at the

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:36 - 20:39] same time. So be careful in general with what

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:39 - 20:43] you distribute in hard copy and

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:42 - 20:45] you can do presentations

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:45 - 20:48] by Zoom. They don't need to be in person but be

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:48 - 20:52] prepared for a lot of questioning. It

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:51 - 20:54] does depend on your employee base how large

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:54 - 20:57] a company of course whether you're Global but also

**[Speaker nan]**


[20:57 - 20:59] the company culture really makes a difference.

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:00 - 21:03] Recursion we had a very transparent culture

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:03 - 21:06] free IPO and we

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:06 - 21:09] also have an endlessly curious and

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:09 - 21:12] questioning and you know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:12 - 21:15] very intelligent employee base. And so they would just

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:15 - 21:18] pepper us with questions. And at one point

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:18 - 21:22] I considered preparing an FAQ document because

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:21 - 21:24] some of the questions would occur and

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:24 - 21:27] you know, you're saying the same things over and over

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:27 - 21:29] but there's a real downside to having

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:30 - 21:33] You know any kind of information in writing other

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:33 - 21:36] than the actual insider trading policy and

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:36 - 21:39] the scrubbed deck that is

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:39 - 21:43] the equity overview. So ultimately we didn't have FAQs

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:42 - 21:44] that we prepared.

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:47 - 21:50] But we also had asked me anything sessions in

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:50 - 21:53] addition to the three categories of training that

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:53 - 21:56] I mentioned and there are people could have more

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:56 - 21:59] one-on-one attention and obviously as I said

**[Speaker nan]**


[21:59 - 22:02] before you can't be giving people investment or tax advice, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:03 - 22:07] Some folks need that personal attention. The stock

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:07 - 22:10] administrator is absolutely critical

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:10 - 22:13] in this regard. I really recommend having your

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:13 - 22:19] stock administrator hired pre-ipo hire

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:17 - 22:20] someone with a ton of

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:20 - 22:23] experience if possible. They will save

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:23 - 22:27] you they will help with this education and the communication and

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:26 - 22:29] they're able to hold people's hands

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:29 - 22:32] in a way that you will not have the

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:32 - 22:36] time to do and also the distribution of information. It's

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:35 - 22:38] a great spot. If you decide you're going to

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:38 - 22:41] put out pieces and when we work with companies, we actually

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:41 - 22:45] do because we feel like you got to educate them. Yeah, providing

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:44 - 22:47] Financial or tax advice, but you can you can

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:47 - 22:48] simplify.

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:48 - 22:51] A lot of complicated things for them and then

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:51 - 22:54] you can refer them off to wherever you firm, but

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:54 - 22:57] the stock administrators portals or the employees

**[Speaker nan]**


[22:57 - 23:00] go and they're looking at all their information. They also

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:00 - 23:04] at least one who's in the room share works

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:03 - 23:06] and I think Carter has

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:06 - 23:09] it as well. All of that is is a great spot to

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:09 - 23:12] be the repository for that information. So you

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:12 - 23:15] make sure everyone's getting the same information. It's been blessed

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:15 - 23:18] by legal. It's been blessed by around in tax. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:18 - 23:21] Yeah and your broker will be really helpful from

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:21 - 23:24] an education perspective. You know,

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:24 - 23:27] when when you asked part of your

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:27 - 23:30] question was what would I do differently? Yeah. Yeah, one of the things

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:30 - 23:34] I think I would do differently is engage much

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:33 - 23:36] more with the broker. We didn't have much

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:36 - 23:40] time, you know to get things done. But ultimately we

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:40 - 23:44] went with Fidelity which has amazing educational materials

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:43 - 23:46] available on its website and they

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:46 - 23:48] also offer personal advisors.

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:49 - 23:52] We chose the option that everyone in the company could

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:52 - 23:56] have their own advisor not just Executives and

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:55 - 23:58] they that's a

**[Speaker nan]**


[23:58 - 24:01] great resource for folks. I also

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:01 - 24:06] would have hired our stock administrator sooner that

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:04 - 24:07] individual was hired right

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:07 - 24:10] around the same time. I was so three months into our

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:10 - 24:13] four months of Ikea preparation.

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:13 - 24:16] So we were both learning the company and you

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:16 - 24:19] know learning the employee base

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:19 - 24:22] at the same time and I

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:22 - 24:25] also would wait longer to put an espp in place. You

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:25 - 24:28] don't need to rush to do that that could have waited.

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:28 - 24:32] For a year, I mean there was liquidity from the IPO.

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:31 - 24:34] So there was no great need for

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:34 - 24:39] it. But we're very ambitious company and

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:37 - 24:40] I certainly were just looking

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:40 - 24:43] at that as another perk. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was partly that

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:43 - 24:46] Talent retention aspect. Yeah, so we

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:46 - 24:49] have 15% discount with the espp that

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:49 - 24:51] we put in place and

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:53 - 24:56] While that was a big lift from an education

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:56 - 24:59] standpoint, I think it was also really attractive for our

**[Speaker nan]**


[24:59 - 25:02] employees. Yeah, and I hadn't thought

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:02 - 25:05] about it until now but it would be interesting to see

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:05 - 25:08] if that comes back into the you know, because you have you have

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:08 - 25:10] Now options versus rsues people.

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:11 - 25:15] Scared of the RSU plans and what's happening and the

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:14 - 25:17] reasons why they're not going to

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:17 - 25:18] go the option plan route. So

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:20 - 25:24] I'll be interesting. Mm-hmm. So any other parting wisdom?

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:23 - 25:26] Yeah, we only

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:26 - 25:29] have a couple minutes left but I would say with respect to

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:29 - 25:32] 10b51 plans. They're if you're

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:32 - 25:35] at a smaller company, they're going to be a

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:35 - 25:38] bit of a bear to handle and this is a place where the stock

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:38 - 25:40] administrator can come in really helpful, too.

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:42 - 25:45] If you have a company with the level of

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:45 - 25:48] transparency that I mentioned then you'll have way more people

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:48 - 25:51] who need or arguably, you know should have 10

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:51 - 25:54] B, five one plans then at another type

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:54 - 25:57] of company and it can

**[Speaker nan]**


[25:57 - 26:00] scare your broker initially Fidelity told us

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:00 - 26:03] we couldn't have that many people with tend to be

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:03 - 26:06] five one plans because they were used to only section 16

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:06 - 26:09] officers and directors and the like having those

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:09 - 26:12] plans and our company we had about 50 people

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:12 - 26:15] with Tempe 51 plus which is a lot especially

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:15 - 26:18] as you know, Ebola like all

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:18 - 26:19] at one time.

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:20 - 26:21] but

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:22 - 26:25] The alternative if folks don't want to attend b51 plan

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:25 - 26:28] is you put many people on a pre-clearance

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:28 - 26:31] list. And so your stock administrator is

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:31 - 26:34] going to be really helpful for you in kind of

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:34 - 26:37] administering the pre-clearance list as well.

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:37 - 26:41] You need a checklist for pre-clearance and you

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:40 - 26:43] know, the admin can prepare much of

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:43 - 26:46] that and then you as compliance officer

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:46 - 26:50] essentially will be validating that they

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:49 - 26:52] are pre-cleared to trade but

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:52 - 26:55] it's a constant flow either of 10

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:55 - 26:58] B5 one plan review Drafting and review or

**[Speaker nan]**


[26:58 - 27:00] of the pretty clearance.

**[Speaker nan]**


[27:01 - 27:02] Thank you. Yeah.

**[Speaker nan]**


[27:04 - 27:06] I think that's that's all we have time for.
