[0.385 - 3.805] It is my pleasure to welcome Jill Simeon,

[3.865 - 5.685] the general counsel of Etsy.

[6.275 - 8.325] I've, um, had the pleasure of hearing her speak

[8.325 - 11.085] before, so I know that we're in for a real treat today,

[11.505 - 13.165] and she's speaking today on diversity

[13.505 - 16.485] and inclusion, which in today's, um, political

[16.485 - 20.525] and legal climate, um, is definitely a hot topic for us

[20.585 - 21.805] to be discussing.

[22.505 - 24.125] And, um, being a,

[24.405 - 27.765] a leader in an organization in the general counsel role,

[27.765 - 31.125] really now is not just something that we, um,

[31.515 - 33.685] that we should be thinking about and being a leader on,

[33.685 - 35.445] but really something that we must be thinking about

[35.505 - 36.565] and being a leader on.

[37.265 - 41.365] So, um, Jill's led the, the legal team, not just at Etsy,

[41.425 - 42.965] but before that, at some of the largest

[43.105 - 45.805] and most recognizable publicly traded companies,

[45.905 - 48.205] and she's going to be sharing her wisdom with us here today.

[48.575 - 49.575] Thank you.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[56.785 - 59.205] Hi, everybody. So I'm here before the wine, huh?

[60.545 - 62.485] Um, are we up there? Yeah.

[62.905 - 64.205] So first of all, thank you

[64.625 - 67.005] and thanks, tech juicy for inviting me.

[67.985 - 70.805] Um, so I think, uh, first of all, what's Etsy?

[70.805 - 75.125] We are, um, a homegrown New York, uh,

[75.195 - 76.405] tech tech company.

[76.585 - 79.485] We are a marketplace for unique, um,

[79.835 - 81.365] handcrafted vintage goods.

[82.105 - 86.485] And, um, we have pretty unusual stats for a tech company.

[86.985 - 88.965] We have about 2 million active sellers.

[89.385 - 92.045] Um, more than 87% of them, um,

[92.425 - 94.405] of our sellers identify as women.

[95.145 - 99.805] Um, we have a 50 50 board gender split, um,

[100.025 - 102.485] and the number of leaders in our tech, in our tech company,

[102.485 - 104.325] which is also a little bit unusual, who identifies women,

[104.425 - 106.285] is a little over 52%.

[107.945 - 111.085] And so, uh, that has led to us being a company

[111.085 - 113.165] that's perceived and actually is pretty

[113.165 - 114.445] good on gender diversity.

[115.305 - 119.525] Um, we have, uh, a generous parental leave, uh, six months,

[119.945 - 120.965] uh, of paid leave,

[120.965 - 122.645] which I think is probably industry leading.

[123.185 - 126.085] Um, we have, uh, gender neutral bathrooms.

[126.085 - 127.645] We were one of the first companies to do that.

[128.305 - 130.365] Um, we've done pay equity studies

[130.425 - 132.965] and we share the results with our board and publicly

[132.965 - 133.965] and with our employees.

[134.505 - 136.005] Um, we've done a lot of things

[136.005 - 138.845] that really have focused on, uh, gender equity.

[138.845 - 141.165] And as a result, um, we've really built a company

[141.165 - 143.925] that is a pretty, um, gender balanced workplace.

[145.145 - 147.285] Um, with our parental leave, we got some notice

[147.345 - 148.565] for a lot of notice for that.

[148.985 - 152.085] Um, we made it, um, applicable to both men and women.

[152.545 - 153.725] Um, and we wanted, we did that

[153.725 - 155.685] because we wanted to make sure that there wasn't a knock on

[155.685 - 157.565] effect in women taking a leave

[157.785 - 159.645] and then sort of falling behind in their careers.

[159.645 - 162.365] So both women and men both qualify for six months leave.

[164.225 - 168.805] And as a result of this very intentional, um, uh,

[169.075 - 171.525] efforts in gender balance, having a brand

[171.525 - 174.005] that certainly attracts women, brought in a lot of women,

[174.095 - 175.765] women tend to bring in other women.

[176.225 - 179.445] Um, we ended up with a tech company that has, um,

[179.785 - 182.125] and has historically had a, uh,

[182.125 - 185.165] pretty impressive gender balanced even more women than men.

[187.105 - 188.605] And even, I suppose you're asking,

[188.605 - 189.685] well, what about the tech roles?

[190.025 - 192.365] Um, even when you double click on the, on the,

[192.385 - 195.165] the tech groups within the company, you'll see

[195.165 - 197.325] that there's a pretty high percentage of women there.

[197.525 - 198.685] There's still further to go,

[198.985 - 201.125] but we're certainly ahead of most of our peers.

[202.705 - 203.765] But when you dig in,

[204.225 - 206.845] and this is one of the questions I asked when I first went

[206.845 - 208.125] to Etsy in 2017.

[208.635 - 209.885] Well, what about everyone else?

[210.835 - 212.405] Another picture started to emerge,

[212.505 - 213.565] and we had to acknowledge

[213.565 - 215.925] that while we were doing really great on gender balance

[216.145 - 218.165] for a tech company, we weren't really doing

[218.225 - 220.525] as well in attracting other groups of people

[220.865 - 223.045] and really focusing on other protected classes.

[226.705 - 228.685] And so you can see here that there's a, there's a,

[228.685 - 229.805] there's a big, there's a big gap

[229.805 - 231.285] and a big, a long way to go for, um,

[231.385 - 232.685] racial, racial diversity.

[235.345 - 237.445] And so I wasn't the only one to notice this.

[237.445 - 238.845] We started be some being suppressed

[238.845 - 241.725] that Etsy's still a white man and women's world,

[242.465 - 243.725] and it really was a company

[243.955 - 245.765] that had a lot of good intentions.

[246.225 - 248.885] Um, we're a company where, um, people really, folk,

[248.885 - 251.285] we did tons of unconscious bias training.

[251.465 - 253.525] People were talking a lot about diversity.

[254.065 - 257.325] People were, um, we were hiring consultants,

[257.345 - 260.205] we were doing studies, and yet we weren't moving the needle.

[260.425 - 261.925] And so the question really was,

[262.665 - 264.005] you have a lot of good intentions.

[264.025 - 265.405] People are activated.

[265.425 - 267.565] We weren't debating whether there were virtues of diversity,

[267.565 - 270.965] whether the diversity was important part of, of our values

[271.185 - 272.965] and important part of the strength of our company,

[273.545 - 274.725] and yet we weren't moving the needle.

[274.745 - 276.725] And so the question is, what do you do?

[277.145 - 279.565] How do you, how do you get, how do you get to action?

[280.265 - 281.365] And so, at the same time,

[281.465 - 284.005] and this was around 2 20 17, I arrived in January.

[285.145 - 289.925] Um, s**t happened, uh, Etsy. Etsy had activists.

[290.425 - 294.045] And the prevailing narrative then, uh, unfortunately, was

[294.045 - 296.565] that Etsy had to choose between being a progressive company

[297.025 - 298.485] and being a profitable company.

[299.385 - 302.125] And the prevailing attitude was that we needed to stop

[302.125 - 303.325] with the artisanal snacks,

[303.505 - 305.165] and we needed to stop, you know, looming

[305.165 - 307.565] and having, you know, quirky Halloween parties.

[307.665 - 309.685] And we needed to really focus on the bottom line.

[310.025 - 311.765] And it was really an either or choice.

[315.545 - 316.765] And you can, I love deal breaker.

[319.025 - 322.365] And the, the, the hope of, uh, of deal breaker,

[322.385 - 323.765] and I think others, was that we,

[323.865 - 325.165] we had made the choice when we were

[325.165 - 326.325] gonna turn to the dark side.

[326.345 - 328.965] And I love this. Now that they're done trying to do good

[329.025 - 331.965] or whatever, Etsy has some actual value.

[333.345 - 337.405] Um, the good news is that what we realized,

[337.425 - 338.525] we had a new CEO

[338.705 - 342.805] and he really, um, was very focused on us, uh, figuring out

[342.805 - 344.005] how to be a profitable company.

[344.065 - 346.245] But he also firmly believed that the values

[346.265 - 348.165] of Etsy were part of what made us great.

[348.545 - 350.325] Um, and so that we weren't throwing out the baby

[350.325 - 351.605] with the bath water, and

[351.605 - 353.885] that we were really focusing on our business.

[353.885 - 356.365] And a core component of our business was the fact

[356.365 - 357.925] that we were a good, good company, and we didn't have

[357.925 - 360.165] to choose between being a company that does good

[360.185 - 361.885] and being a company that was successful.

[364.065 - 366.245] And so, at that point, at that, at that sort

[366.245 - 368.765] of pivotal moment, we had to say, you know,

[368.765 - 370.205] what does building a diverse workplace

[370.205 - 371.285] culture mean for Etsy?

[371.395 - 372.485] What is Etsy all about?

[373.065 - 375.725] And so this began a larger process in the company.

[377.145 - 378.325] We came up with a new mission,

[378.705 - 381.485] and we, our new mission is, is to keep commerce human.

[382.145 - 383.485] And what does that really mean? It means

[383.485 - 385.525] that we're a company that's really about human connections.

[385.525 - 387.485] And if anyone's ever bought anything on Etsy, you know,

[387.485 - 391.365] that you're buying from like some quirky Mary Sue in Kansas

[391.435 - 393.845] City, and she's gonna, you know, send it with a little note

[394.045 - 395.245] and maybe a little piece of candy.

[395.665 - 399.085] And that's like a very human thing in today's modern world.

[399.545 - 402.005] Um, I had a friend this past year who, um,

[402.005 - 403.765] passed away from with breast cancer.

[404.365 - 406.245] I wanted to get something that was very personal

[406.425 - 408.325] for her family that was related to some fabric.

[408.385 - 411.365] She designed. I sent the fabric to, um, this woman.

[411.385 - 413.845] She designed these very personal and beautiful things.

[414.105 - 415.725] She shared her story of her loss

[415.865 - 417.085] for a friend with, um, cancer.

[417.625 - 419.565] And it was the most incredible, um,

[419.575 - 421.485] e-commerce experience I've ever had.

[421.905 - 424.125] Um, this is Etsy. Etsy is about the people.

[424.235 - 425.485] It's not just about our sellers,

[425.485 - 427.605] it's about our employees, it's about our vendors.

[427.635 - 430.085] It's about the entire ecosystem that we're trying to create.

[430.985 - 432.365] So how does that translate?

[434.025 - 436.205] And so from there, we built some guiding principles

[436.985 - 439.205] and, you know, commit to our craft.

[439.305 - 441.245] Yes, okay, sure, there's a pun 'cause we're Etsy.

[441.625 - 443.245] But really we're talking about talent

[443.305 - 445.525] and we're talking about valuing people based on their

[445.525 - 448.125] performance, not on perceptions, not on, you know, oh,

[448.125 - 451.725] you went to my college, but really focusing on talent

[451.785 - 453.965] and performance, minimizing waste.

[454.345 - 456.365] You'll see in a minute we developed an impact goal

[456.365 - 459.325] that was really valuing, um, our, our resources,

[459.955 - 462.405] embracing differences that goes directly to diversity.

[462.825 - 464.965] Um, digging deeper, leading with optimism.

[464.965 - 466.525] And these guiding principles became

[466.585 - 468.045] how we start talking about things

[468.225 - 470.405] and thinking about how we show up at work,

[470.745 - 473.245] how we treat others, how we value ourselves,

[473.345 - 475.325] and how we make for an equitable workplace.

[478.005 - 480.305] Now, as we were building our business goals, one

[480.305 - 482.545] of the things our new CEO Josh Silverman said was really,

[482.545 - 486.625] we had to, um, we had to focus on fewer things.

[487.135 - 489.265] When he arrived also in 2017,

[489.365 - 491.265] we were doing 20,000 really great things.

[491.765 - 493.545] And he said, let's pick 10.

[494.015 - 496.025] What are the most important things to move the needle?

[496.205 - 497.505] And let's do those things really

[497.535 - 499.225] well, and let's measure them.

[499.235 - 501.585] Let's set KPIs, measure our success,

[502.245 - 503.705] and then we will figure out how

[503.705 - 505.025] to move the needle with 10 things.

[505.205 - 508.985] And that's a hard decision with our impact and social goals.

[509.045 - 510.625] Before 2017, we also,

[510.625 - 512.025] we were doing a lot of really great things.

[512.025 - 513.545] We had a million speakers come in.

[513.685 - 517.585] We had initiatives, we had, um, lots of, lots of workshops,

[517.765 - 518.945] but we weren't moving the needle.

[519.045 - 521.145] And so also with our impact initiatives,

[521.145 - 523.105] we decide let's focus on the key things.

[523.415 - 525.585] What are the most important impact initiatives

[525.585 - 526.625] we can do as Etsy?

[527.125 - 529.305] And how do we make it not a silo over there,

[529.645 - 532.625] but how do we integrate it into our culture so

[532.625 - 533.825] that everybody owns these things?

[534.325 - 536.565] And so we picked three, we wanted

[536.565 - 538.045] to focus on economic impact.

[538.225 - 539.765] And let's face it, that's our day job.

[540.145 - 543.085] We provide economic security for 2 million women.

[543.085 - 544.365] Most of our businesses are women.

[544.575 - 547.405] Their, their businesses are one, and it changes their lives.

[548.345 - 551.325] We, um, focus on social impact, which is diversity.

[551.745 - 553.525] And in terms of that, we're talking about employees.

[553.685 - 555.925] We're talking about our brand, we're talking about vendors,

[556.295 - 558.245] we're talking about our whole Etsy ecosystem.

[558.625 - 561.045] And then we're talking about ecological impact.

[561.545 - 563.485] And that was really what's our carbon footprint

[563.825 - 565.685] and what can we do to make it smaller?

[566.345 - 567.245] Now, I could sit here and

[567.245 - 568.365] talk to you about all three of these topics.

[568.365 - 571.165] That's not my topic today. Um, that's for another day.

[571.185 - 574.845] But we, if you wanna look in our, our k we've, we, our 10 K,

[575.265 - 576.925] um, we report on all of these

[577.145 - 579.125] and we've really made some goals, um, some,

[579.195 - 580.325] some progress on our goals.

[584.145 - 586.365] So really what we're talking about, when you take three

[586.905 - 589.325] impact goals and you say they're not separate from your

[589.565 - 591.245] business, when you say they're part

[591.265 - 593.205] of your overall business initiative,

[593.675 - 597.485] then you're talking about integrating impact,

[597.485 - 599.805] social impact into your business model.

[600.265 - 602.445] And what we are viewing it as is a flywheel.

[602.445 - 604.605] Because if we don't have a diverse workplace,

[604.825 - 607.085] if we're not hiring vendors that support our values,

[607.705 - 610.085] if we're, if we're, if we're polluting all over the place,

[610.385 - 612.205] if we're not rewarding fairly

[612.305 - 614.925] and equitably, then we're not creating a business

[614.925 - 616.045] that's sustainable.

[616.905 - 619.805] And by putting them together, everybody owns diversity.

[619.915 - 622.285] Everybody owns building an equitable workplace.

[622.705 - 624.685] And then you start creating a flywheel.

[625.025 - 627.005] And this is what we saw with women when I started.

[627.305 - 629.565] We saw really great talented women coming

[629.565 - 631.645] to Etsy naturally because of our brand.

[631.985 - 633.445] And we saw them inviting and,

[633.465 - 635.205] and bringing on other talented women.

[635.385 - 638.005] And we saw them building a workplace

[638.005 - 639.765] that was equitable based on gender,

[639.865 - 641.565] and it created a flywheel in which

[641.565 - 642.685] that was really successful.

[643.225 - 644.685] And so what we realized is that we needed

[644.685 - 646.765] to create a flywheel for everybody,

[647.345 - 649.685] and we needed to create a flywheel in which we were really

[649.685 - 652.925] addressing with data how to make Etsy a more diverse

[652.925 - 653.925] and inclusive workplace.

[657.105 - 659.765] So this is Etsy's, uh, diversity goal

[659.985 - 661.405] to enable equitable access

[661.405 - 663.165] to the opportunities that we create.

[664.195 - 665.405] It's a pretty broad goal.

[665.705 - 669.525] And we decided that was really our overarching longer term

[669.595 - 672.565] goal, but specifically, we set three sub goals.

[673.085 - 674.085] I don't know if you can see that,

[674.145 - 675.925] but, um, they're around employees,

[675.925 - 677.205] vendors, and the marketplace.

[677.785 - 680.765] And they're really specific goals for employees.

[680.765 - 682.765] We wanted to double the percentage of black, black

[682.765 - 687.085] and Latinx employees and NCS workforce by 2023 for vendors.

[687.185 - 689.885] We wanted to focus more on, um, equitable

[689.885 - 690.965] and sustainable vendors.

[691.545 - 693.645] Um, and we didn't even have a real,

[693.845 - 695.485] I would say a real vendor management system.

[695.505 - 697.285] So there's a lot of infrastructure that would have to happen

[697.425 - 698.765] to have that to, to get us there.

[699.425 - 701.205] Um, and in our marketplace, we wanted

[701.205 - 702.725] to be more inclusive and welcoming.

[703.325 - 704.765] I can't tell you every time I walk into a room

[704.765 - 706.765] and say, I am from Etsy, the women at the table

[706.865 - 707.885] say, oh, I love Etsy.

[707.885 - 709.605] And the men say, oh, my wife likes Etsy.

[710.635 - 712.045] There's a way for our, there's a way

[712.045 - 713.045] to go on our brand there.

[713.625 - 715.525] Um, and so that was something

[715.525 - 717.445] that's something we've been very consciously focusing on.

[720.335 - 722.355] So we're all lawyers. And I guess the question is,

[722.455 - 723.995] what's legal supposed to do about all of this?

[724.025 - 725.995] That sounds like a, like a, a pretty big remit.

[726.295 - 728.035] And the answer is that, um, I

[728.035 - 729.795] and my team have been really involved

[729.795 - 730.915] in this entire process.

[732.095 - 734.995] Um, we've been very involved in advising the business

[734.995 - 737.635] and helping them integrate, um, diversity

[737.815 - 740.715] and inclusion into how we do our business every day.

[741.975 - 743.915] And so what we did is we went

[743.915 - 746.915] and we looked at the data, uh, we looked at the data

[747.015 - 749.635] for our, our, our from hr.

[749.695 - 752.035] We looked at the data in our advertising,

[752.255 - 754.995] we looked at the data in pictures on our website,

[755.015 - 756.835] and we said, where are we falling off?

[757.575 - 760.115] How do we begin to address this holistically?

[760.735 - 762.555] And we started to ask these five questions.

[764.885 - 769.075] There are questions around recruiting, hiring, retaining,

[769.465 - 771.355] promoting, and measuring.

[771.655 - 773.075] And I'll go through these one by one.

[776.705 - 778.645] How do you attract a diverse set

[778.645 - 780.445] of candidates into your pipeline?

[781.225 - 782.725] One of the things we had to acknowledge was

[782.725 - 784.925] that our pipeline was unequal.

[784.925 - 786.365] We were attracting tons and tons of women.

[787.105 - 788.925] Um, some of our teams are all women.

[789.355 - 791.125] Some of our teams are almost all men.

[791.585 - 794.845] And we weren't really focusing on attracting different ages.

[794.845 - 797.485] We weren't really foc attract, um, focusing on attracting,

[797.745 - 799.085] um, people from different, um,

[799.305 - 800.805] racial and ethnic backgrounds.

[801.025 - 802.365] And we were realizing they were falling out

[802.365 - 803.605] of the pipeline at different points

[803.665 - 804.805] in the recruiting process.

[805.425 - 807.565] So how do we recruit more diversely?

[807.825 - 808.885] And we looked at the data

[809.145 - 813.205] and we were able to set up, um, areas

[813.305 - 814.485] of focus for different groups.

[815.265 - 817.285] So where do you focus? It's gonna vary from person

[817.305 - 818.685] to person, from company to company.

[818.945 - 820.365] It might even vary team to team.

[820.665 - 822.205] But you can look at your recruiting data

[822.225 - 823.885] and say, where are groups falling off

[824.105 - 827.245] and how can we focus our recruiting specifically

[828.065 - 829.165] to target different groups?

[830.465 - 832.125] We reviewed our recruiting materials.

[832.345 - 835.165] We realized, like the first picture I opened up,

[835.165 - 837.005] you saw there's a picture of people crafting in hands.

[837.265 - 840.045] We realized a lot of our pictures, the hands were all white.

[840.435 - 842.405] What is that? That sense? A really strong message about

[842.405 - 843.445] who etsy's for.

[843.945 - 845.885] So we started looking at our recruiting materials,

[845.885 - 848.805] and we wanted to reflect the diversity of, of the culture.

[848.945 - 853.085] We, we, we wanted to build who's going to job fairs?

[853.705 - 854.965] We started asking that question,

[854.985 - 856.845] and we realized that the same two, um,

[857.145 - 859.285] people from HR were going to all the job fairs.

[859.285 - 862.525] They didn't represent, they didn't represent diversity, um,

[862.705 - 864.045] but they also didn't represent the diversity

[864.105 - 866.445] of the work in our, in our, in our company.

[866.705 - 868.725] And so we started inviting people from different areas,

[868.725 - 870.965] people, people who are engineers, people in hr,

[871.305 - 872.405] people in marketing.

[872.625 - 874.365] And we started presenting a more diverse

[874.365 - 875.725] portfolio of our employees.

[876.505 - 879.445] How diverse is your brand? What are your ads look like?

[879.505 - 882.725] Who is in them? We have employee resource groups.

[883.225 - 884.365] We had, we, we turned to them

[884.365 - 886.965] and we said, how do you think we should diver, uh,

[886.995 - 888.885] diversify our employee population?

[888.995 - 890.125] They had a lot of great ideas.

[890.555 - 892.245] They started attending job fairs.

[892.745 - 895.685] One of the little caveats with that is that you need

[895.685 - 898.725] to be really, really conscious about not relying too much on

[898.725 - 901.445] your ERGs because they have a full-time job

[901.445 - 903.405] and they really wanna be on the track of being an engineer.

[903.405 - 905.365] They don't wanna become a, a second shift

[906.065 - 907.405] HR person and a recruiter.

[907.825 - 910.645] Um, and so when we, when we engage our ERGs

[910.645 - 913.125] to help us recruit, we really focus on making sure

[913.125 - 914.765] that their managers on board with that

[914.905 - 917.245] and that they get extra recognition, maybe a little bonus,

[917.245 - 919.285] things like that, so that they are rewarded

[919.505 - 921.525] and they are steamed for that contribution.

[922.385 - 926.405] We offer referral bonuses and we measure, measure, measure.

[926.405 - 930.125] There is weekly reporting on diversity, hiring statistics,

[930.705 - 932.405] um, to the executive team.

[932.625 - 935.085] That's a lot of focus. And when you measure

[935.085 - 936.165] something, it moves.

[938.625 - 940.205] So I don't, there's a great ad here,

[940.205 - 942.445] which I think it's got PDF and you can't see,

[943.585 - 945.525] but if you Google it, you'll notice we're gonna have a,

[945.525 - 950.095] we have a big, no, we have a big,

[950.315 - 953.775] uh, fall and winter holiday ad campaign.

[954.275 - 956.415] And what we did for the first time this year was

[956.415 - 959.655] that we sent, um, people from our diversity

[959.715 - 962.535] and inclusion team in HR along to the photo shoot,

[963.355 - 964.735] and they helped, um,

[965.125 - 967.775] pick a more diverse portfolio of actors.

[968.235 - 970.575] Um, they said like, this setting doesn't seem realistic.

[970.575 - 971.895] This setting seems more realistic.

[972.235 - 973.535] And they were there in advising

[973.635 - 975.495] and making sure that people felt represented.

[975.515 - 979.495] And the results of the ads are really great hiring,

[979.755 - 981.455] how you ensure that hiring is fair,

[981.905 - 983.615] consistent, and inclusive.

[986.285 - 988.025] Um, this was a big challenge

[988.025 - 989.705] because we'd done a lot of, as I mentioned

[989.705 - 991.745] before, we'd done a lot of unconscious bias training.

[992.165 - 994.625] People were very activated, people were very aware

[994.625 - 997.945] of biases, and yet the numbers for hiring were not moving.

[998.565 - 999.705] Um, and so we, they said,

[999.705 - 1000.825] well, we just, we just don't know what to do.

[1000.925 - 1002.705] How do we, how, what are the tactics?

[1003.165 - 1005.705] And so we worked with, um, our employment council,

[1005.805 - 1010.505] and we really, we built a skills rubric for every open rec.

[1011.445 - 1013.705] And we said, when you go into the interview,

[1014.005 - 1016.545] we should not be talking about, oh, you're in that sorority.

[1016.605 - 1017.825] So am I. Or Oh my gosh,

[1017.825 - 1018.985] you live right near my brother-In-law.

[1019.045 - 1020.745] We, those are the things that are bias.

[1021.525 - 1023.785] And when people are relating to people they're interviewing

[1023.785 - 1026.025] with through, um, on the basis of things

[1026.025 - 1029.145] that are not skills, that are not requirements for the job,

[1029.685 - 1030.865] the result is

[1030.865 - 1031.825] that you're getting a biased

[1031.825 - 1033.465] influence on the hiring process.

[1034.055 - 1036.345] When you stick to the skills required for the job,

[1036.455 - 1038.425] everybody's getting more or less the same questions

[1038.965 - 1042.785] and you're pulling from the entire population of, of,

[1042.965 - 1044.225] of relevant candidates.

[1044.325 - 1047.505] And you're having a really unbiased process to hire.

[1048.775 - 1050.915] Um, so we train teams on how to interview.

[1051.615 - 1054.315] We calibrate our hiring decisions to make sure that people

[1054.315 - 1055.635] who are getting hired for similar jobs

[1055.855 - 1057.035] are getting similar comp.

[1058.575 - 1059.915] That's a really important thing

[1059.915 - 1063.035] because you don't want then somebody to be, you have, uh,

[1063.525 - 1064.875] hired somebody, you bring them in

[1064.875 - 1066.035] and then they talk to their peer

[1066.215 - 1068.395] and they realize, oh my gosh, I have a very different comp.

[1069.185 - 1071.925] And sometimes it happens. It happens unconsciously.

[1072.065 - 1074.325] And if you're not paying attention to it, it leads

[1074.325 - 1077.405] to somebody leaving the Mansfield Rooney Rule.

[1077.445 - 1080.325] I don't know. Does anybody have people using that? Yes. No.

[1080.915 - 1084.485] Yeah, we, um, the Rooney Rule was from the NFL.

[1084.485 - 1086.365] It, it suggested that you bring in, uh,

[1086.385 - 1088.245] one diverse candidate to every panel.

[1088.625 - 1090.125] Um, the Mansfield rule is,

[1090.185 - 1093.045] is targeted specifically towards lawyers saying bring in two

[1093.045 - 1097.205] or more diverse candidates, um, to every interview panel,

[1097.465 - 1099.925] um, so that you are more likely to consider them.

[1099.925 - 1102.325] It, it makes you conscious of bringing in a diverse pool.

[1102.895 - 1105.085] We've been doing this. One of the challenges with this, and,

[1105.085 - 1107.485] and that we've talking about it with the legal team is

[1107.485 - 1109.485] that people often don't self-identify.

[1109.945 - 1112.325] And so we had a situation where people were guessing

[1112.325 - 1113.445] what people's backgrounds were,

[1113.445 - 1115.805] which is not really a great way of targeting diversity.

[1115.905 - 1118.925] And then HR is keeping like a secret list, not good.

[1119.385 - 1123.085] Um, so what we did was we started talking more

[1123.085 - 1125.245] to the candidates about why we're collecting this data.

[1125.245 - 1126.485] We're collecting it for good reasons.

[1126.745 - 1128.205] We, these are our diversity goals.

[1128.205 - 1130.205] We're interested in building a diverse workforce.

[1130.625 - 1133.605] And when you do that, then you start to unlock this problem

[1133.825 - 1137.845] of, of people disclosing, um, hiring panel.

[1137.865 - 1139.365] We also realized we were, we would go

[1139.365 - 1142.365] and we'd have, we'd be bringing in a diverse can, uh, panel

[1142.365 - 1144.085] of candidates, and then we'd look

[1144.105 - 1146.245] and it would be, you know, five, uh,

[1146.245 - 1147.925] white guy engineers on the hiring panel.

[1147.925 - 1149.405] We're like, that doesn't even reflect our company.

[1149.505 - 1151.125] But it happened, you know, accidentally.

[1151.505 - 1154.245] So we're trying to be more conscious about the

[1154.245 - 1155.405] diversity of our panels.

[1156.825 - 1158.845] Um, we also work with HR

[1158.845 - 1160.485] to make it a more hospitable process.

[1160.745 - 1162.645] We make sure that they're aware of what's going on,

[1162.645 - 1164.005] that they're aware that there's a regular

[1164.005 - 1165.405] process, that they're part of it.

[1165.865 - 1168.645] Um, and we also maintain an internal pipeline.

[1168.645 - 1169.765] This person was really great.

[1169.765 - 1172.245] This is a really great candidate, not for this role,

[1172.665 - 1175.165] but we're conscious about just not letting them drop into

[1175.165 - 1177.125] the endless bucket of like, oh, not this role.

[1177.125 - 1178.445] Maybe never. Um,

[1178.545 - 1180.885] but really when we find a great candidate referring them

[1180.885 - 1185.405] for other roles, retaining,

[1187.185 - 1189.485] Um, we run, we, we do an annual,

[1189.585 - 1191.165] do people here do engagement surveys?

[1192.355 - 1194.125] Yeah, we do a, an engagement survey.

[1194.225 - 1196.125] And that's really great for uncovering hotspots.

[1196.125 - 1198.205] We discover that, oh my gosh, there's a perception

[1198.205 - 1200.205] of unfairness on the X team.

[1200.465 - 1203.085] That's something that we really wanna address, or so

[1203.085 - 1206.285] and so is a, a manager who is, you know, showing

[1206.285 - 1207.525] what appears to be a lot of bias.

[1208.265 - 1211.805] Um, we do comp surveys to make sure that comp is equitable.

[1212.035 - 1215.325] When we do, um, we have set up a mentorship program.

[1215.825 - 1217.765] We focus on the, we've built a vendor,

[1218.185 - 1219.565] um, screening program.

[1220.025 - 1221.605] So we're not only screening them to make sure

[1221.605 - 1223.525] that they're not like, you know, drug traffickers

[1223.525 - 1226.445] or terrorists, but we also ask them like, do you, do you do,

[1227.225 - 1229.805] um, do you hire diverse, um, employees?

[1229.825 - 1231.365] Do you train them on sexual harassment?

[1231.365 - 1233.325] We wanna make sure that we're working with good vendors.

[1234.305 - 1237.165] Um, we have set up and funded employee resource groups,

[1237.165 - 1238.485] and as I said before, we're making sure

[1238.485 - 1239.925] that we're not overly taxing them.

[1240.545 - 1242.885] Um, we maintain anti-harassment

[1242.885 - 1245.605] and non-discrimination policies and training, um,

[1245.785 - 1249.325] and we train managers to handle, uh, sensitive issues.

[1249.755 - 1250.925] This has been really interesting.

[1251.025 - 1252.405] We found that the online training

[1252.405 - 1253.645] didn't really work with managers.

[1253.845 - 1255.285] 'cause people would come and say, we have a lot

[1255.285 - 1256.365] of really young managers.

[1256.905 - 1258.365] And their friend would be like, oh my gosh,

[1258.485 - 1260.605] I was at the bar last night with like a bunch of, you know,

[1260.765 - 1262.365] engineers, and someone was like a little bit handsy

[1262.425 - 1265.965] and they would not see that as a report of harassment.

[1266.665 - 1268.405] And they felt like that was their friend,

[1268.405 - 1269.645] even though they're now managing them.

[1269.785 - 1273.725] And so we really had to train a workforce of young managers

[1273.725 - 1276.445] to understand when something is a report of harassment

[1276.445 - 1281.085] or other, other situation and find and, uh, promote.

[1281.105 - 1283.165] How do you ensure that promotion processes are fair,

[1283.445 - 1284.445] consistent, inclusive?

[1285.105 - 1286.485] Uh, we've recently completely

[1286.575 - 1288.205] overhauled our promotion process.

[1288.825 - 1292.085] We do calibrations across the entire, um, org.

[1292.665 - 1297.085] Um, we, um, talk about diversity, inclusion and promotions.

[1297.085 - 1299.885] We make sure that our promotions don't end up unconsciously

[1299.885 - 1301.125] having biases in them.

[1301.625 - 1303.925] We are really focused on paper performance.

[1303.935 - 1306.125] Every role has metrics. Are people meeting them?

[1306.125 - 1310.245] They set goals. Um, when I say calibration, everybody who's,

[1310.265 - 1313.885] um, like an M five across the entire org,

[1314.155 - 1315.165] they get calibrated

[1315.165 - 1316.405] to make sure they're getting paid fairly,

[1316.705 - 1320.045] not necessarily the same pay from one, one job, uh, group

[1320.065 - 1322.005] to another, but within that job group,

[1322.025 - 1323.285] are they being paid fairly?

[1324.225 - 1326.845] Um, you should also think about considering a,

[1326.925 - 1328.205] a formal sponsorship program.

[1328.685 - 1330.325] I know a lot of times in law firms they have that,

[1330.325 - 1331.965] but oftentimes in companies you don't.

[1332.385 - 1335.165] And we've created, um, a lot of ways for their, um,

[1335.405 - 1337.565] employees to find informal sponsorship within the company.

[1339.885 - 1341.025] And finally, measuring,

[1341.025 - 1343.025] measuring has really been the key to all of this.

[1344.365 - 1347.785] Um, we have set all

[1347.785 - 1350.065] of our impact goals, um, publicly.

[1350.235 - 1351.865] We've shared them with all of our employees.

[1352.115 - 1353.305] We've shared them with the board.

[1353.525 - 1357.785] And then this past year, we took the step of having a, uh,

[1357.785 - 1359.265] integrated annual report.

[1360.015 - 1363.545] This means that we have put all our goals into our 10 k,

[1363.545 - 1364.785] our filing with the SEC.

[1365.285 - 1367.065] Now, before we did that, I said, you know, listen,

[1367.205 - 1370.105] I'm not going to be endorsing this if we are not

[1370.105 - 1371.225] sure that these numbers are real.

[1371.565 - 1373.905] And so we hired KPMG to help us audit our numbers.

[1374.565 - 1378.425] Um, and we, we disclose all of our stats.

[1379.005 - 1382.505] Um, and let me tell you, everybody feels ownership of that,

[1382.505 - 1383.625] just like they feel ownership.

[1383.625 - 1385.265] And when I said that this was really integrated

[1385.265 - 1387.065] with our business and part of the flywheel,

[1387.445 - 1389.745] people feel ownership of this as part

[1389.745 - 1390.785] of the results of the company.

[1390.935 - 1392.305] Everybody owns diversity.

[1393.565 - 1396.185] Um, so that may not be for everybody.

[1396.305 - 1398.505] I know a lot of people are not part of public companies,

[1398.505 - 1400.225] but there's a lots, there are lots of ways

[1400.645 - 1402.025] of creating accountability,

[1402.365 - 1404.665] shared accountability and disclosing it.

[1405.085 - 1406.865] And I think if you don't say it out loud

[1407.085 - 1409.225] and you don't commit to reasonable goals

[1409.285 - 1411.385] and you don't measure, you don't get progress.

[1413.495 - 1416.435] So as I said, we, we put, um, all

[1416.435 - 1418.115] of this data into our integrator report.

[1418.395 - 1419.555] I think you should go check it out.

[1419.935 - 1422.475] Um, it's, if you go onto a website, you can just look

[1422.475 - 1423.835] for the 2018 annual report.

[1424.065 - 1426.245] It's really unusual. There aren't companies

[1426.245 - 1427.485] that are doing this, um,

[1427.485 - 1430.645] unless they've like, you know, killed every penguin in the,

[1430.645 - 1431.645] the southern hemisphere.

[1431.905 - 1433.685] Uh, usually that's when they feel pressured

[1433.685 - 1436.085] to like make some sort of a environmental commitment.

[1436.385 - 1439.165] Um, I would love to see more companies looking at their

[1439.225 - 1441.965] impact goals and realizing that being, uh,

[1441.965 - 1444.685] a good company is being a good corporate citizen,

[1445.065 - 1446.565] and that you could do this at any size

[1446.905 - 1450.645] and it makes you, um, viewed as a

[1451.325 - 1452.765] positive corporate citizen, your investors,

[1452.795 - 1454.445] your shareholders alike, given,

[1454.575 - 1456.965] given the larger environment that we're in.

[1457.305 - 1460.325] Um, I think there is a real support for companies

[1460.325 - 1462.845] that are concerned with being good corporate citizens

[1463.345 - 1465.085] and not just, you know, greenwashing,

[1465.085 - 1466.885] not just putting out fake intentions,

[1467.065 - 1468.645] but really measuring and moving the needle.

[1470.305 - 1474.005] And so I guess my key takeaways here are, um,

[1474.345 - 1477.045] ask hard questions, uh, dig into the data.

[1477.705 - 1479.725] Um, we really found out that where we were,

[1479.725 - 1481.005] where we were dropping off

[1481.005 - 1483.725] and unsuccessful was very obvious once we looked at the

[1483.725 - 1484.805] numbers and looked at the data.

[1485.545 - 1489.405] Um, we built a culture that really, uh, supported diversity

[1489.585 - 1491.805] and, and also viewed it as part

[1491.825 - 1493.205] of the success of the company.

[1493.345 - 1496.565] Having a diverse workforce, having diverse vendors, um,

[1496.655 - 1500.245] supporting our diverse community was really who we are.

[1501.265 - 1505.605] And then finally, divine, uh, define a lifecycle program for

[1506.285 - 1508.965] bringing, um, people into your workforce and your community.

[1509.175 - 1511.325] Don't look at it as, as piecemeal, um,

[1511.385 - 1513.885] but really keep, uh, on track of it from,

[1514.475 - 1516.125] from the initial part of trying

[1516.125 - 1517.765] to bring people into the company through

[1518.005 - 1519.085] the whole time that they're there.

[1520.665 - 1523.445] All of this was not done in a year or a week or an hour.

[1523.585 - 1525.285] All of this has been done over several years,

[1525.585 - 1528.845] and it can be scaled to different sizes, but by measuring

[1529.185 - 1531.165] and reporting and getting people on board,

[1531.225 - 1532.285] you can really move the needle.

[1532.655 - 1533.655] Thank you.

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[1540.005 - 1543.045] I think we have time for one question before happy hour

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[1545.465 - 1546.605] In between you and the wine,

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[1554.025 - 1558.525] Um, this really goes to kind of discussions of diversity

[1558.655 - 1561.565] among your employees, um, either employee forums

[1561.825 - 1563.565] or engagement groups.

[1564.465 - 1566.845] How comfortable are you letting employees kind

[1566.845 - 1568.485] of self moderate those conversations?

[1568.505 - 1572.405] Or how do you put guardrails in place that ensure

[1572.405 - 1576.325] that those conversations remain positive, um,

[1576.505 - 1579.485] and not just causing additional issues

[1579.545 - 1580.885] for, for you as the company?

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[1582.635 - 1584.445] Yeah, so we have a lot of different ways

[1584.445 - 1586.685] that we talk about, um, diversity,

[1586.785 - 1588.205] but also our broader impact goals.

[1588.545 - 1590.325] Um, we report on them, um,

[1590.715 - 1593.725] quarterly at our our town hall meeting.

[1594.465 - 1596.805] Um, and we have a lot of broad people

[1597.365 - 1598.925] involved in different parts of it reporting,

[1599.025 - 1600.445] and there's a q and a there.

[1600.985 - 1605.925] Um, we, we provide, um, disclosure on our impact report, um,

[1606.135 - 1609.685] after our, um, engagement survey when topics come up,

[1609.685 - 1611.805] we create round tables where people can talk.

[1611.945 - 1613.405] If we feel like if it's a hotspot,

[1613.505 - 1614.805] we will have those moderated

[1614.805 - 1617.925] or facilitated, um, not by senior management,

[1617.925 - 1619.445] but by people in the company who are trusted.

[1619.465 - 1621.605] And we talk to them about how to facilitate it.

[1622.225 - 1625.885] Um, but we also, what we have come up with is a charter

[1625.945 - 1630.045] of mindful communication, which really is a way of

[1630.605 - 1632.085] reframing sometimes questions get asked

[1632.085 - 1633.525] that are not asked in a really nice way,

[1633.785 - 1635.085] but if you peel it back, there's a

[1635.085 - 1636.125] really legitimate question there.

[1636.585 - 1638.965] And so by putting up, whenever we have our q

[1638.965 - 1640.725] and a, the charter of mindful communication,

[1640.725 - 1644.125] which is like read the room, um, ask, ask questions

[1644.125 - 1647.005] that you really want answered, assume best intentions, it's,

[1647.005 - 1648.165] it's, you know, a few basics.

[1648.385 - 1652.365] Um, by doing that, um, people tend to reframe questions

[1652.365 - 1654.845] that could start off as hostile into construction,

[1655.245 - 1656.725] constructive questions, um,

[1656.865 - 1658.925] and other people in the room will call them out on

[1658.925 - 1660.005] it and say, reframe that.

[1660.425 - 1662.085] Um, and it'll get reframed

[1662.085 - 1664.485] and it leads to a, I think, a pretty healthy dialogue.

[1664.915 - 1667.885] What I think is really important is not shutting out avenues

[1667.885 - 1669.125] where these conversations happen,

[1669.155 - 1670.525] because they'll go underground.

[1670.985 - 1673.725] And I think it's really important to have your, your, um,

[1674.235 - 1676.765] your finger on the pulse of people's concerns.

[1677.265 - 1681.085] If there is, um, inequity that's half bubbling up somewhere,

[1681.145 - 1683.245] or if people are perceiving that something is unfair,

[1683.665 - 1685.125] and if you're not open to listening

[1685.125 - 1686.205] to it, it doesn't go away.

[1686.785 - 1689.605] It gets buried. And then that's when you have, um, you know,

[1689.805 - 1690.805] I think you end up with a workforce

[1690.805 - 1692.205] that doesn't really feel like you're, it's a,

[1692.205 - 1694.045] it's a fair place to work, huh?

[1694.585 - 1696.325] It used to be. Just Thank you.

**[Speaker 0.0]**


[1702.025 - 1703.645] If you have the opportunity to speak

[1703.645 - 1705.805] with Jill Moore later, um, make sure to ask her

[1705.805 - 1708.805] for some funny stories about things like, um, refusing

[1708.865 - 1712.245] to sell Wiccan potions and, um, fake urine.

[1715.425 - 1718.605] Um, um, one of my very first responsibilities

[1718.705 - 1721.805] as a GC almost eight years ago, uh, was actually

[1721.945 - 1724.485] to help facilitate the transition of one

[1724.485 - 1727.405] of our male engineers, um, from male to female.

[1728.145 - 1729.525] And, um, this was kind of

[1729.525 - 1732.565] before, it was a more common thing to happen in workplaces,

[1733.025 - 1736.165] and it was tough to take a leadership role in those kinds

[1736.165 - 1738.565] of conversations, really, um,

[1739.515 - 1741.925] intense conversations across the organization.

[1742.505 - 1744.085] But they are honestly some

[1744.085 - 1746.205] of the most memorable conversations of my life.

[1746.315 - 1749.005] Like really intense conversations about what does it mean

[1749.005 - 1751.125] to be a man and what does it mean to be a woman.

[1751.865 - 1755.605] Um, and I would just really encourage you to lean in to the,

[1755.865 - 1757.765] to the leadership role in, um,

[1757.845 - 1760.325] facilitating conversations about diversity

[1760.465 - 1762.245] and inclusion in your organizations.

[1763.945 - 1766.645] So we're now gonna have a quick networking break.

[1767.165 - 1770.285] I understand we'll be followed by some closing remarks from,

[1770.345 - 1771.365] um, Kieran and Greg

[1771.365 - 1774.005] before we go downstairs for the closing bell this afternoon.

[1774.465 - 1776.525] And I just wanted to say thank you so much

[1776.585 - 1778.365] for letting me spend the day with you today.
