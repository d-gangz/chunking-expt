[00:00 - 00:03] It is my pleasure to welcome Jill Simeon,

[00:03 - 00:05] the general counsel of Etsy.

[00:06 - 00:08] I've, um, had the pleasure of hearing her speak

[00:08 - 00:11] before, so I know that we're in for a real treat today,

[00:11 - 00:13] and she's speaking today on diversity

[00:13 - 00:16] and inclusion, which in today's, um, political

[00:16 - 00:20] and legal climate, um, is definitely a hot topic for us

[00:20 - 00:21] to be discussing.

[00:22 - 00:24] And, um, being a,

[00:24 - 00:27] a leader in an organization in the general counsel role,

[00:27 - 00:31] really now is not just something that we, um,

[00:31 - 00:33] that we should be thinking about and being a leader on,

[00:33 - 00:35] but really something that we must be thinking about

[00:35 - 00:36] and being a leader on.

[00:37 - 00:41] So, um, Jill's led the, the legal team, not just at Etsy,

[00:41 - 00:42] but before that, at some of the largest

[00:43 - 00:45] and most recognizable publicly traded companies,

[00:45 - 00:48] and she's going to be sharing her wisdom with us here today.

[00:48 - 00:49] Thank you.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[00:56 - 00:59] Hi, everybody. So I'm here before the wine, huh?

[01:00 - 01:02] Um, are we up there? Yeah.

[01:02 - 01:04] So first of all, thank you

[01:04 - 01:07] and thanks, tech juicy for inviting me.

[01:07 - 01:10] Um, so I think, uh, first of all, what's Etsy?

[01:10 - 01:15] We are, um, a homegrown New York, uh,

[01:15 - 01:16] tech tech company.

[01:16 - 01:19] We are a marketplace for unique, um,

[01:19 - 01:21] handcrafted vintage goods.

[01:22 - 01:26] And, um, we have pretty unusual stats for a tech company.

[01:26 - 01:28] We have about 2 million active sellers.

[01:29 - 01:32] Um, more than 87% of them, um,

[01:32 - 01:34] of our sellers identify as women.

[01:35 - 01:39] Um, we have a 50 50 board gender split, um,

[01:40 - 01:42] and the number of leaders in our tech, in our tech company,

[01:42 - 01:44] which is also a little bit unusual, who identifies women,

[01:44 - 01:46] is a little over 52%.

[01:47 - 01:51] And so, uh, that has led to us being a company

[01:51 - 01:53] that's perceived and actually is pretty

[01:53 - 01:54] good on gender diversity.

[01:55 - 01:59] Um, we have, uh, a generous parental leave, uh, six months,

[01:59 - 02:00] uh, of paid leave,

[02:00 - 02:02] which I think is probably industry leading.

[02:03 - 02:06] Um, we have, uh, gender neutral bathrooms.

[02:06 - 02:07] We were one of the first companies to do that.

[02:08 - 02:10] Um, we've done pay equity studies

[02:10 - 02:12] and we share the results with our board and publicly

[02:12 - 02:13] and with our employees.

[02:14 - 02:16] Um, we've done a lot of things

[02:16 - 02:18] that really have focused on, uh, gender equity.

[02:18 - 02:21] And as a result, um, we've really built a company

[02:21 - 02:23] that is a pretty, um, gender balanced workplace.

[02:25 - 02:27] Um, with our parental leave, we got some notice

[02:27 - 02:28] for a lot of notice for that.

[02:28 - 02:32] Um, we made it, um, applicable to both men and women.

[02:32 - 02:33] Um, and we wanted, we did that

[02:33 - 02:35] because we wanted to make sure that there wasn't a knock on

[02:35 - 02:37] effect in women taking a leave

[02:37 - 02:39] and then sort of falling behind in their careers.

[02:39 - 02:42] So both women and men both qualify for six months leave.

[02:44 - 02:48] And as a result of this very intentional, um, uh,

[02:49 - 02:51] efforts in gender balance, having a brand

[02:51 - 02:54] that certainly attracts women, brought in a lot of women,

[02:54 - 02:55] women tend to bring in other women.

[02:56 - 02:59] Um, we ended up with a tech company that has, um,

[02:59 - 03:02] and has historically had a, uh,

[03:02 - 03:05] pretty impressive gender balanced even more women than men.

[03:07 - 03:08] And even, I suppose you're asking,

[03:08 - 03:09] well, what about the tech roles?

[03:10 - 03:12] Um, even when you double click on the, on the,

[03:12 - 03:15] the tech groups within the company, you'll see

[03:15 - 03:17] that there's a pretty high percentage of women there.

[03:17 - 03:18] There's still further to go,

[03:18 - 03:21] but we're certainly ahead of most of our peers.

[03:22 - 03:23] But when you dig in,

[03:24 - 03:26] and this is one of the questions I asked when I first went

[03:26 - 03:28] to Etsy in 2017.

[03:28 - 03:29] Well, what about everyone else?

[03:30 - 03:32] Another picture started to emerge,

[03:32 - 03:33] and we had to acknowledge

[03:33 - 03:35] that while we were doing really great on gender balance

[03:36 - 03:38] for a tech company, we weren't really doing

[03:38 - 03:40] as well in attracting other groups of people

[03:40 - 03:43] and really focusing on other protected classes.

[03:46 - 03:48] And so you can see here that there's a, there's a,

[03:48 - 03:49] there's a big, there's a big gap

[03:49 - 03:51] and a big, a long way to go for, um,

[03:51 - 03:52] racial, racial diversity.

[03:55 - 03:57] And so I wasn't the only one to notice this.

[03:57 - 03:58] We started be some being suppressed

[03:58 - 04:01] that Etsy's still a white man and women's world,

[04:02 - 04:03] and it really was a company

[04:03 - 04:05] that had a lot of good intentions.

[04:06 - 04:08] Um, we're a company where, um, people really, folk,

[04:08 - 04:11] we did tons of unconscious bias training.

[04:11 - 04:13] People were talking a lot about diversity.

[04:14 - 04:17] People were, um, we were hiring consultants,

[04:17 - 04:20] we were doing studies, and yet we weren't moving the needle.

[04:20 - 04:21] And so the question really was,

[04:22 - 04:24] you have a lot of good intentions.

[04:24 - 04:25] People are activated.

[04:25 - 04:27] We weren't debating whether there were virtues of diversity,

[04:27 - 04:30] whether the diversity was important part of, of our values

[04:31 - 04:32] and important part of the strength of our company,

[04:33 - 04:34] and yet we weren't moving the needle.

[04:34 - 04:36] And so the question is, what do you do?

[04:37 - 04:39] How do you, how do you get, how do you get to action?

[04:40 - 04:41] And so, at the same time,

[04:41 - 04:44] and this was around 2 20 17, I arrived in January.

[04:45 - 04:49] Um, s**t happened, uh, Etsy. Etsy had activists.

[04:50 - 04:54] And the prevailing narrative then, uh, unfortunately, was

[04:54 - 04:56] that Etsy had to choose between being a progressive company

[04:57 - 04:58] and being a profitable company.

[04:59 - 05:02] And the prevailing attitude was that we needed to stop

[05:02 - 05:03] with the artisanal snacks,

[05:03 - 05:05] and we needed to stop, you know, looming

[05:05 - 05:07] and having, you know, quirky Halloween parties.

[05:07 - 05:09] And we needed to really focus on the bottom line.

[05:10 - 05:11] And it was really an either or choice.

[05:15 - 05:16] And you can, I love deal breaker.

[05:19 - 05:22] And the, the, the hope of, uh, of deal breaker,

[05:22 - 05:23] and I think others, was that we,

[05:23 - 05:25] we had made the choice when we were

[05:25 - 05:26] gonna turn to the dark side.

[05:26 - 05:28] And I love this. Now that they're done trying to do good

[05:29 - 05:31] or whatever, Etsy has some actual value.

[05:33 - 05:37] Um, the good news is that what we realized,

[05:37 - 05:38] we had a new CEO

[05:38 - 05:42] and he really, um, was very focused on us, uh, figuring out

[05:42 - 05:44] how to be a profitable company.

[05:44 - 05:46] But he also firmly believed that the values

[05:46 - 05:48] of Etsy were part of what made us great.

[05:48 - 05:50] Um, and so that we weren't throwing out the baby

[05:50 - 05:51] with the bath water, and

[05:51 - 05:53] that we were really focusing on our business.

[05:53 - 05:56] And a core component of our business was the fact

[05:56 - 05:57] that we were a good, good company, and we didn't have

[05:57 - 06:00] to choose between being a company that does good

[06:00 - 06:01] and being a company that was successful.

[06:04 - 06:06] And so, at that point, at that, at that sort

[06:06 - 06:08] of pivotal moment, we had to say, you know,

[06:08 - 06:10] what does building a diverse workplace

[06:10 - 06:11] culture mean for Etsy?

[06:11 - 06:12] What is Etsy all about?

[06:13 - 06:15] And so this began a larger process in the company.

[06:17 - 06:18] We came up with a new mission,

[06:18 - 06:21] and we, our new mission is, is to keep commerce human.

[06:22 - 06:23] And what does that really mean? It means

[06:23 - 06:25] that we're a company that's really about human connections.

[06:25 - 06:27] And if anyone's ever bought anything on Etsy, you know,

[06:27 - 06:31] that you're buying from like some quirky Mary Sue in Kansas

[06:31 - 06:33] City, and she's gonna, you know, send it with a little note

[06:34 - 06:35] and maybe a little piece of candy.

[06:35 - 06:39] And that's like a very human thing in today's modern world.

[06:39 - 06:42] Um, I had a friend this past year who, um,

[06:42 - 06:43] passed away from with breast cancer.

[06:44 - 06:46] I wanted to get something that was very personal

[06:46 - 06:48] for her family that was related to some fabric.

[06:48 - 06:51] She designed. I sent the fabric to, um, this woman.

[06:51 - 06:53] She designed these very personal and beautiful things.

[06:54 - 06:55] She shared her story of her loss

[06:55 - 06:57] for a friend with, um, cancer.

[06:57 - 06:59] And it was the most incredible, um,

[06:59 - 07:01] e-commerce experience I've ever had.

[07:01 - 07:04] Um, this is Etsy. Etsy is about the people.

[07:04 - 07:05] It's not just about our sellers,

[07:05 - 07:07] it's about our employees, it's about our vendors.

[07:07 - 07:10] It's about the entire ecosystem that we're trying to create.

[07:10 - 07:12] So how does that translate?

[07:14 - 07:16] And so from there, we built some guiding principles

[07:16 - 07:19] and, you know, commit to our craft.

[07:19 - 07:21] Yes, okay, sure, there's a pun 'cause we're Etsy.

[07:21 - 07:23] But really we're talking about talent

[07:23 - 07:25] and we're talking about valuing people based on their

[07:25 - 07:28] performance, not on perceptions, not on, you know, oh,

[07:28 - 07:31] you went to my college, but really focusing on talent

[07:31 - 07:33] and performance, minimizing waste.

[07:34 - 07:36] You'll see in a minute we developed an impact goal

[07:36 - 07:39] that was really valuing, um, our, our resources,

[07:39 - 07:42] embracing differences that goes directly to diversity.

[07:42 - 07:44] Um, digging deeper, leading with optimism.

[07:44 - 07:46] And these guiding principles became

[07:46 - 07:48] how we start talking about things

[07:48 - 07:50] and thinking about how we show up at work,

[07:50 - 07:53] how we treat others, how we value ourselves,

[07:53 - 07:55] and how we make for an equitable workplace.

[07:58 - 08:00] Now, as we were building our business goals, one

[08:00 - 08:02] of the things our new CEO Josh Silverman said was really,

[08:02 - 08:06] we had to, um, we had to focus on fewer things.

[08:07 - 08:09] When he arrived also in 2017,

[08:09 - 08:11] we were doing 20,000 really great things.

[08:11 - 08:13] And he said, let's pick 10.

[08:14 - 08:16] What are the most important things to move the needle?

[08:16 - 08:17] And let's do those things really

[08:17 - 08:19] well, and let's measure them.

[08:19 - 08:21] Let's set KPIs, measure our success,

[08:22 - 08:23] and then we will figure out how

[08:23 - 08:25] to move the needle with 10 things.

[08:25 - 08:28] And that's a hard decision with our impact and social goals.

[08:29 - 08:30] Before 2017, we also,

[08:30 - 08:32] we were doing a lot of really great things.

[08:32 - 08:33] We had a million speakers come in.

[08:33 - 08:37] We had initiatives, we had, um, lots of, lots of workshops,

[08:37 - 08:38] but we weren't moving the needle.

[08:39 - 08:41] And so also with our impact initiatives,

[08:41 - 08:43] we decide let's focus on the key things.

[08:43 - 08:45] What are the most important impact initiatives

[08:45 - 08:46] we can do as Etsy?

[08:47 - 08:49] And how do we make it not a silo over there,

[08:49 - 08:52] but how do we integrate it into our culture so

[08:52 - 08:53] that everybody owns these things?

[08:54 - 08:56] And so we picked three, we wanted

[08:56 - 08:58] to focus on economic impact.

[08:58 - 08:59] And let's face it, that's our day job.

[09:00 - 09:03] We provide economic security for 2 million women.

[09:03 - 09:04] Most of our businesses are women.

[09:04 - 09:07] Their, their businesses are one, and it changes their lives.

[09:08 - 09:11] We, um, focus on social impact, which is diversity.

[09:11 - 09:13] And in terms of that, we're talking about employees.

[09:13 - 09:15] We're talking about our brand, we're talking about vendors,

[09:16 - 09:18] we're talking about our whole Etsy ecosystem.

[09:18 - 09:21] And then we're talking about ecological impact.

[09:21 - 09:23] And that was really what's our carbon footprint

[09:23 - 09:25] and what can we do to make it smaller?

[09:26 - 09:27] Now, I could sit here and

[09:27 - 09:28] talk to you about all three of these topics.

[09:28 - 09:31] That's not my topic today. Um, that's for another day.

[09:31 - 09:34] But we, if you wanna look in our, our k we've, we, our 10 K,

[09:35 - 09:36] um, we report on all of these

[09:37 - 09:39] and we've really made some goals, um, some,

[09:39 - 09:40] some progress on our goals.

[09:44 - 09:46] So really what we're talking about, when you take three

[09:46 - 09:49] impact goals and you say they're not separate from your

[09:49 - 09:51] business, when you say they're part

[09:51 - 09:53] of your overall business initiative,

[09:53 - 09:57] then you're talking about integrating impact,

[09:57 - 09:59] social impact into your business model.

[10:00 - 10:02] And what we are viewing it as is a flywheel.

[10:02 - 10:04] Because if we don't have a diverse workplace,

[10:04 - 10:07] if we're not hiring vendors that support our values,

[10:07 - 10:10] if we're, if we're, if we're polluting all over the place,

[10:10 - 10:12] if we're not rewarding fairly

[10:12 - 10:14] and equitably, then we're not creating a business

[10:14 - 10:16] that's sustainable.

[10:16 - 10:19] And by putting them together, everybody owns diversity.

[10:19 - 10:22] Everybody owns building an equitable workplace.

[10:22 - 10:24] And then you start creating a flywheel.

[10:25 - 10:27] And this is what we saw with women when I started.

[10:27 - 10:29] We saw really great talented women coming

[10:29 - 10:31] to Etsy naturally because of our brand.

[10:31 - 10:33] And we saw them inviting and,

[10:33 - 10:35] and bringing on other talented women.

[10:35 - 10:38] And we saw them building a workplace

[10:38 - 10:39] that was equitable based on gender,

[10:39 - 10:41] and it created a flywheel in which

[10:41 - 10:42] that was really successful.

[10:43 - 10:44] And so what we realized is that we needed

[10:44 - 10:46] to create a flywheel for everybody,

[10:47 - 10:49] and we needed to create a flywheel in which we were really

[10:49 - 10:52] addressing with data how to make Etsy a more diverse

[10:52 - 10:53] and inclusive workplace.

[10:57 - 10:59] So this is Etsy's, uh, diversity goal

[10:59 - 11:01] to enable equitable access

[11:01 - 11:03] to the opportunities that we create.

[11:04 - 11:05] It's a pretty broad goal.

[11:05 - 11:09] And we decided that was really our overarching longer term

[11:09 - 11:12] goal, but specifically, we set three sub goals.

[11:13 - 11:14] I don't know if you can see that,

[11:14 - 11:15] but, um, they're around employees,

[11:15 - 11:17] vendors, and the marketplace.

[11:17 - 11:20] And they're really specific goals for employees.

[11:20 - 11:22] We wanted to double the percentage of black, black

[11:22 - 11:27] and Latinx employees and NCS workforce by 2023 for vendors.

[11:27 - 11:29] We wanted to focus more on, um, equitable

[11:29 - 11:30] and sustainable vendors.

[11:31 - 11:33] Um, and we didn't even have a real,

[11:33 - 11:35] I would say a real vendor management system.

[11:35 - 11:37] So there's a lot of infrastructure that would have to happen

[11:37 - 11:38] to have that to, to get us there.

[11:39 - 11:41] Um, and in our marketplace, we wanted

[11:41 - 11:42] to be more inclusive and welcoming.

[11:43 - 11:44] I can't tell you every time I walk into a room

[11:44 - 11:46] and say, I am from Etsy, the women at the table

[11:46 - 11:47] say, oh, I love Etsy.

[11:47 - 11:49] And the men say, oh, my wife likes Etsy.

[11:50 - 11:52] There's a way for our, there's a way

[11:52 - 11:53] to go on our brand there.

[11:53 - 11:55] Um, and so that was something

[11:55 - 11:57] that's something we've been very consciously focusing on.

[12:00 - 12:02] So we're all lawyers. And I guess the question is,

[12:02 - 12:03] what's legal supposed to do about all of this?

[12:04 - 12:05] That sounds like a, like a, a pretty big remit.

[12:06 - 12:08] And the answer is that, um, I

[12:08 - 12:09] and my team have been really involved

[12:09 - 12:10] in this entire process.

[12:12 - 12:14] Um, we've been very involved in advising the business

[12:14 - 12:17] and helping them integrate, um, diversity

[12:17 - 12:20] and inclusion into how we do our business every day.

[12:21 - 12:23] And so what we did is we went

[12:23 - 12:26] and we looked at the data, uh, we looked at the data

[12:27 - 12:29] for our, our, our from hr.

[12:29 - 12:32] We looked at the data in our advertising,

[12:32 - 12:34] we looked at the data in pictures on our website,

[12:35 - 12:36] and we said, where are we falling off?

[12:37 - 12:40] How do we begin to address this holistically?

[12:40 - 12:42] And we started to ask these five questions.

[12:44 - 12:49] There are questions around recruiting, hiring, retaining,

[12:49 - 12:51] promoting, and measuring.

[12:51 - 12:53] And I'll go through these one by one.

[12:56 - 12:58] How do you attract a diverse set

[12:58 - 13:00] of candidates into your pipeline?

[13:01 - 13:02] One of the things we had to acknowledge was

[13:02 - 13:04] that our pipeline was unequal.

[13:04 - 13:06] We were attracting tons and tons of women.

[13:07 - 13:08] Um, some of our teams are all women.

[13:09 - 13:11] Some of our teams are almost all men.

[13:11 - 13:14] And we weren't really focusing on attracting different ages.

[13:14 - 13:17] We weren't really foc attract, um, focusing on attracting,

[13:17 - 13:19] um, people from different, um,

[13:19 - 13:20] racial and ethnic backgrounds.

[13:21 - 13:22] And we were realizing they were falling out

[13:22 - 13:23] of the pipeline at different points

[13:23 - 13:24] in the recruiting process.

[13:25 - 13:27] So how do we recruit more diversely?

[13:27 - 13:28] And we looked at the data

[13:29 - 13:33] and we were able to set up, um, areas

[13:33 - 13:34] of focus for different groups.

[13:35 - 13:37] So where do you focus? It's gonna vary from person

[13:37 - 13:38] to person, from company to company.

[13:38 - 13:40] It might even vary team to team.

[13:40 - 13:42] But you can look at your recruiting data

[13:42 - 13:43] and say, where are groups falling off

[13:44 - 13:47] and how can we focus our recruiting specifically

[13:48 - 13:49] to target different groups?

[13:50 - 13:52] We reviewed our recruiting materials.

[13:52 - 13:55] We realized, like the first picture I opened up,

[13:55 - 13:57] you saw there's a picture of people crafting in hands.

[13:57 - 14:00] We realized a lot of our pictures, the hands were all white.

[14:00 - 14:02] What is that? That sense? A really strong message about

[14:02 - 14:03] who etsy's for.

[14:03 - 14:05] So we started looking at our recruiting materials,

[14:05 - 14:08] and we wanted to reflect the diversity of, of the culture.

[14:08 - 14:13] We, we, we wanted to build who's going to job fairs?

[14:13 - 14:14] We started asking that question,

[14:14 - 14:16] and we realized that the same two, um,

[14:17 - 14:19] people from HR were going to all the job fairs.

[14:19 - 14:22] They didn't represent, they didn't represent diversity, um,

[14:22 - 14:24] but they also didn't represent the diversity

[14:24 - 14:26] of the work in our, in our, in our company.

[14:26 - 14:28] And so we started inviting people from different areas,

[14:28 - 14:30] people, people who are engineers, people in hr,

[14:31 - 14:32] people in marketing.

[14:32 - 14:34] And we started presenting a more diverse

[14:34 - 14:35] portfolio of our employees.

[14:36 - 14:39] How diverse is your brand? What are your ads look like?

[14:39 - 14:42] Who is in them? We have employee resource groups.

[14:43 - 14:44] We had, we, we turned to them

[14:44 - 14:46] and we said, how do you think we should diver, uh,

[14:46 - 14:48] diversify our employee population?

[14:48 - 14:50] They had a lot of great ideas.

[14:50 - 14:52] They started attending job fairs.

[14:52 - 14:55] One of the little caveats with that is that you need

[14:55 - 14:58] to be really, really conscious about not relying too much on

[14:58 - 15:01] your ERGs because they have a full-time job

[15:01 - 15:03] and they really wanna be on the track of being an engineer.

[15:03 - 15:05] They don't wanna become a, a second shift

[15:06 - 15:07] HR person and a recruiter.

[15:07 - 15:10] Um, and so when we, when we engage our ERGs

[15:10 - 15:13] to help us recruit, we really focus on making sure

[15:13 - 15:14] that their managers on board with that

[15:14 - 15:17] and that they get extra recognition, maybe a little bonus,

[15:17 - 15:19] things like that, so that they are rewarded

[15:19 - 15:21] and they are steamed for that contribution.

[15:22 - 15:26] We offer referral bonuses and we measure, measure, measure.

[15:26 - 15:30] There is weekly reporting on diversity, hiring statistics,

[15:30 - 15:32] um, to the executive team.

[15:32 - 15:35] That's a lot of focus. And when you measure

[15:35 - 15:36] something, it moves.

[15:38 - 15:40] So I don't, there's a great ad here,

[15:40 - 15:42] which I think it's got PDF and you can't see,

[15:43 - 15:45] but if you Google it, you'll notice we're gonna have a,

[15:45 - 15:50] we have a big, no, we have a big,

[15:50 - 15:53] uh, fall and winter holiday ad campaign.

[15:54 - 15:56] And what we did for the first time this year was

[15:56 - 15:59] that we sent, um, people from our diversity

[15:59 - 16:02] and inclusion team in HR along to the photo shoot,

[16:03 - 16:04] and they helped, um,

[16:05 - 16:07] pick a more diverse portfolio of actors.

[16:08 - 16:10] Um, they said like, this setting doesn't seem realistic.

[16:10 - 16:11] This setting seems more realistic.

[16:12 - 16:13] And they were there in advising

[16:13 - 16:15] and making sure that people felt represented.

[16:15 - 16:19] And the results of the ads are really great hiring,

[16:19 - 16:21] how you ensure that hiring is fair,

[16:21 - 16:23] consistent, and inclusive.

[16:26 - 16:28] Um, this was a big challenge

[16:28 - 16:29] because we'd done a lot of, as I mentioned

[16:29 - 16:31] before, we'd done a lot of unconscious bias training.

[16:32 - 16:34] People were very activated, people were very aware

[16:34 - 16:37] of biases, and yet the numbers for hiring were not moving.

[16:38 - 16:39] Um, and so we, they said,

[16:39 - 16:40] well, we just, we just don't know what to do.

[16:40 - 16:42] How do we, how, what are the tactics?

[16:43 - 16:45] And so we worked with, um, our employment council,

[16:45 - 16:50] and we really, we built a skills rubric for every open rec.

[16:51 - 16:53] And we said, when you go into the interview,

[16:54 - 16:56] we should not be talking about, oh, you're in that sorority.

[16:56 - 16:57] So am I. Or Oh my gosh,

[16:57 - 16:58] you live right near my brother-In-law.

[16:59 - 17:00] We, those are the things that are bias.

[17:01 - 17:03] And when people are relating to people they're interviewing

[17:03 - 17:06] with through, um, on the basis of things

[17:06 - 17:09] that are not skills, that are not requirements for the job,

[17:09 - 17:10] the result is

[17:10 - 17:11] that you're getting a biased

[17:11 - 17:13] influence on the hiring process.

[17:14 - 17:16] When you stick to the skills required for the job,

[17:16 - 17:18] everybody's getting more or less the same questions

[17:18 - 17:22] and you're pulling from the entire population of, of,

[17:22 - 17:24] of relevant candidates.

[17:24 - 17:27] And you're having a really unbiased process to hire.

[17:28 - 17:30] Um, so we train teams on how to interview.

[17:31 - 17:34] We calibrate our hiring decisions to make sure that people

[17:34 - 17:35] who are getting hired for similar jobs

[17:35 - 17:37] are getting similar comp.

[17:38 - 17:39] That's a really important thing

[17:39 - 17:43] because you don't want then somebody to be, you have, uh,

[17:43 - 17:44] hired somebody, you bring them in

[17:44 - 17:46] and then they talk to their peer

[17:46 - 17:48] and they realize, oh my gosh, I have a very different comp.

[17:49 - 17:51] And sometimes it happens. It happens unconsciously.

[17:52 - 17:54] And if you're not paying attention to it, it leads

[17:54 - 17:57] to somebody leaving the Mansfield Rooney Rule.

[17:57 - 18:00] I don't know. Does anybody have people using that? Yes. No.

[18:00 - 18:04] Yeah, we, um, the Rooney Rule was from the NFL.

[18:04 - 18:06] It, it suggested that you bring in, uh,

[18:06 - 18:08] one diverse candidate to every panel.

[18:08 - 18:10] Um, the Mansfield rule is,

[18:10 - 18:13] is targeted specifically towards lawyers saying bring in two

[18:13 - 18:17] or more diverse candidates, um, to every interview panel,

[18:17 - 18:19] um, so that you are more likely to consider them.

[18:19 - 18:22] It, it makes you conscious of bringing in a diverse pool.

[18:22 - 18:25] We've been doing this. One of the challenges with this, and,

[18:25 - 18:27] and that we've talking about it with the legal team is

[18:27 - 18:29] that people often don't self-identify.

[18:29 - 18:32] And so we had a situation where people were guessing

[18:32 - 18:33] what people's backgrounds were,

[18:33 - 18:35] which is not really a great way of targeting diversity.

[18:35 - 18:38] And then HR is keeping like a secret list, not good.

[18:39 - 18:43] Um, so what we did was we started talking more

[18:43 - 18:45] to the candidates about why we're collecting this data.

[18:45 - 18:46] We're collecting it for good reasons.

[18:46 - 18:48] We, these are our diversity goals.

[18:48 - 18:50] We're interested in building a diverse workforce.

[18:50 - 18:53] And when you do that, then you start to unlock this problem

[18:53 - 18:57] of, of people disclosing, um, hiring panel.

[18:57 - 18:59] We also realized we were, we would go

[18:59 - 19:02] and we'd have, we'd be bringing in a diverse can, uh, panel

[19:02 - 19:04] of candidates, and then we'd look

[19:04 - 19:06] and it would be, you know, five, uh,

[19:06 - 19:07] white guy engineers on the hiring panel.

[19:07 - 19:09] We're like, that doesn't even reflect our company.

[19:09 - 19:11] But it happened, you know, accidentally.

[19:11 - 19:14] So we're trying to be more conscious about the

[19:14 - 19:15] diversity of our panels.

[19:16 - 19:18] Um, we also work with HR

[19:18 - 19:20] to make it a more hospitable process.

[19:20 - 19:22] We make sure that they're aware of what's going on,

[19:22 - 19:24] that they're aware that there's a regular

[19:24 - 19:25] process, that they're part of it.

[19:25 - 19:28] Um, and we also maintain an internal pipeline.

[19:28 - 19:29] This person was really great.

[19:29 - 19:32] This is a really great candidate, not for this role,

[19:32 - 19:35] but we're conscious about just not letting them drop into

[19:35 - 19:37] the endless bucket of like, oh, not this role.

[19:37 - 19:38] Maybe never. Um,

[19:38 - 19:40] but really when we find a great candidate referring them

[19:40 - 19:45] for other roles, retaining,

[19:47 - 19:49] Um, we run, we, we do an annual,

[19:49 - 19:51] do people here do engagement surveys?

[19:52 - 19:54] Yeah, we do a, an engagement survey.

[19:54 - 19:56] And that's really great for uncovering hotspots.

[19:56 - 19:58] We discover that, oh my gosh, there's a perception

[19:58 - 20:00] of unfairness on the X team.

[20:00 - 20:03] That's something that we really wanna address, or so

[20:03 - 20:06] and so is a, a manager who is, you know, showing

[20:06 - 20:07] what appears to be a lot of bias.

[20:08 - 20:11] Um, we do comp surveys to make sure that comp is equitable.

[20:12 - 20:15] When we do, um, we have set up a mentorship program.

[20:15 - 20:17] We focus on the, we've built a vendor,

[20:18 - 20:19] um, screening program.

[20:20 - 20:21] So we're not only screening them to make sure

[20:21 - 20:23] that they're not like, you know, drug traffickers

[20:23 - 20:26] or terrorists, but we also ask them like, do you, do you do,

[20:27 - 20:29] um, do you hire diverse, um, employees?

[20:29 - 20:31] Do you train them on sexual harassment?

[20:31 - 20:33] We wanna make sure that we're working with good vendors.

[20:34 - 20:37] Um, we have set up and funded employee resource groups,

[20:37 - 20:38] and as I said before, we're making sure

[20:38 - 20:39] that we're not overly taxing them.

[20:40 - 20:42] Um, we maintain anti-harassment

[20:42 - 20:45] and non-discrimination policies and training, um,

[20:45 - 20:49] and we train managers to handle, uh, sensitive issues.

[20:49 - 20:50] This has been really interesting.

[20:51 - 20:52] We found that the online training

[20:52 - 20:53] didn't really work with managers.

[20:53 - 20:55] 'cause people would come and say, we have a lot

[20:55 - 20:56] of really young managers.

[20:56 - 20:58] And their friend would be like, oh my gosh,

[20:58 - 21:00] I was at the bar last night with like a bunch of, you know,

[21:00 - 21:02] engineers, and someone was like a little bit handsy

[21:02 - 21:05] and they would not see that as a report of harassment.

[21:06 - 21:08] And they felt like that was their friend,

[21:08 - 21:09] even though they're now managing them.

[21:09 - 21:13] And so we really had to train a workforce of young managers

[21:13 - 21:16] to understand when something is a report of harassment

[21:16 - 21:21] or other, other situation and find and, uh, promote.

[21:21 - 21:23] How do you ensure that promotion processes are fair,

[21:23 - 21:24] consistent, inclusive?

[21:25 - 21:26] Uh, we've recently completely

[21:26 - 21:28] overhauled our promotion process.

[21:28 - 21:32] We do calibrations across the entire, um, org.

[21:32 - 21:37] Um, we, um, talk about diversity, inclusion and promotions.

[21:37 - 21:39] We make sure that our promotions don't end up unconsciously

[21:39 - 21:41] having biases in them.

[21:41 - 21:43] We are really focused on paper performance.

[21:43 - 21:46] Every role has metrics. Are people meeting them?

[21:46 - 21:50] They set goals. Um, when I say calibration, everybody who's,

[21:50 - 21:53] um, like an M five across the entire org,

[21:54 - 21:55] they get calibrated

[21:55 - 21:56] to make sure they're getting paid fairly,

[21:56 - 22:00] not necessarily the same pay from one, one job, uh, group

[22:00 - 22:02] to another, but within that job group,

[22:02 - 22:03] are they being paid fairly?

[22:04 - 22:06] Um, you should also think about considering a,

[22:06 - 22:08] a formal sponsorship program.

[22:08 - 22:10] I know a lot of times in law firms they have that,

[22:10 - 22:11] but oftentimes in companies you don't.

[22:12 - 22:15] And we've created, um, a lot of ways for their, um,

[22:15 - 22:17] employees to find informal sponsorship within the company.

[22:19 - 22:21] And finally, measuring,

[22:21 - 22:23] measuring has really been the key to all of this.

[22:24 - 22:27] Um, we have set all

[22:27 - 22:30] of our impact goals, um, publicly.

[22:30 - 22:31] We've shared them with all of our employees.

[22:32 - 22:33] We've shared them with the board.

[22:33 - 22:37] And then this past year, we took the step of having a, uh,

[22:37 - 22:39] integrated annual report.

[22:40 - 22:43] This means that we have put all our goals into our 10 k,

[22:43 - 22:44] our filing with the SEC.

[22:45 - 22:47] Now, before we did that, I said, you know, listen,

[22:47 - 22:50] I'm not going to be endorsing this if we are not

[22:50 - 22:51] sure that these numbers are real.

[22:51 - 22:53] And so we hired KPMG to help us audit our numbers.

[22:54 - 22:58] Um, and we, we disclose all of our stats.

[22:59 - 23:02] Um, and let me tell you, everybody feels ownership of that,

[23:02 - 23:03] just like they feel ownership.

[23:03 - 23:05] And when I said that this was really integrated

[23:05 - 23:07] with our business and part of the flywheel,

[23:07 - 23:09] people feel ownership of this as part

[23:09 - 23:10] of the results of the company.

[23:10 - 23:12] Everybody owns diversity.

[23:13 - 23:16] Um, so that may not be for everybody.

[23:16 - 23:18] I know a lot of people are not part of public companies,

[23:18 - 23:20] but there's a lots, there are lots of ways

[23:20 - 23:22] of creating accountability,

[23:22 - 23:24] shared accountability and disclosing it.

[23:25 - 23:26] And I think if you don't say it out loud

[23:27 - 23:29] and you don't commit to reasonable goals

[23:29 - 23:31] and you don't measure, you don't get progress.

[23:33 - 23:36] So as I said, we, we put, um, all

[23:36 - 23:38] of this data into our integrator report.

[23:38 - 23:39] I think you should go check it out.

[23:39 - 23:42] Um, it's, if you go onto a website, you can just look

[23:42 - 23:43] for the 2018 annual report.

[23:44 - 23:46] It's really unusual. There aren't companies

[23:46 - 23:47] that are doing this, um,

[23:47 - 23:50] unless they've like, you know, killed every penguin in the,

[23:50 - 23:51] the southern hemisphere.

[23:51 - 23:53] Uh, usually that's when they feel pressured

[23:53 - 23:56] to like make some sort of a environmental commitment.

[23:56 - 23:59] Um, I would love to see more companies looking at their

[23:59 - 24:01] impact goals and realizing that being, uh,

[24:01 - 24:04] a good company is being a good corporate citizen,

[24:05 - 24:06] and that you could do this at any size

[24:06 - 24:10] and it makes you, um, viewed as a

[24:11 - 24:12] positive corporate citizen, your investors,

[24:12 - 24:14] your shareholders alike, given,

[24:14 - 24:16] given the larger environment that we're in.

[24:17 - 24:20] Um, I think there is a real support for companies

[24:20 - 24:22] that are concerned with being good corporate citizens

[24:23 - 24:25] and not just, you know, greenwashing,

[24:25 - 24:26] not just putting out fake intentions,

[24:27 - 24:28] but really measuring and moving the needle.

[24:30 - 24:34] And so I guess my key takeaways here are, um,

[24:34 - 24:37] ask hard questions, uh, dig into the data.

[24:37 - 24:39] Um, we really found out that where we were,

[24:39 - 24:41] where we were dropping off

[24:41 - 24:43] and unsuccessful was very obvious once we looked at the

[24:43 - 24:44] numbers and looked at the data.

[24:45 - 24:49] Um, we built a culture that really, uh, supported diversity

[24:49 - 24:51] and, and also viewed it as part

[24:51 - 24:53] of the success of the company.

[24:53 - 24:56] Having a diverse workforce, having diverse vendors, um,

[24:56 - 25:00] supporting our diverse community was really who we are.

[25:01 - 25:05] And then finally, divine, uh, define a lifecycle program for

[25:06 - 25:08] bringing, um, people into your workforce and your community.

[25:09 - 25:11] Don't look at it as, as piecemeal, um,

[25:11 - 25:13] but really keep, uh, on track of it from,

[25:14 - 25:16] from the initial part of trying

[25:16 - 25:17] to bring people into the company through

[25:18 - 25:19] the whole time that they're there.

[25:20 - 25:23] All of this was not done in a year or a week or an hour.

[25:23 - 25:25] All of this has been done over several years,

[25:25 - 25:28] and it can be scaled to different sizes, but by measuring

[25:29 - 25:31] and reporting and getting people on board,

[25:31 - 25:32] you can really move the needle.

[25:32 - 25:33] Thank you.

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[25:40 - 25:43] I think we have time for one question before happy hour

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[25:45 - 25:46] In between you and the wine,

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[25:54 - 25:58] Um, this really goes to kind of discussions of diversity

[25:58 - 26:01] among your employees, um, either employee forums

[26:01 - 26:03] or engagement groups.

[26:04 - 26:06] How comfortable are you letting employees kind

[26:06 - 26:08] of self moderate those conversations?

[26:08 - 26:12] Or how do you put guardrails in place that ensure

[26:12 - 26:16] that those conversations remain positive, um,

[26:16 - 26:19] and not just causing additional issues

[26:19 - 26:20] for, for you as the company?

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[26:22 - 26:24] Yeah, so we have a lot of different ways

[26:24 - 26:26] that we talk about, um, diversity,

[26:26 - 26:28] but also our broader impact goals.

[26:28 - 26:30] Um, we report on them, um,

[26:30 - 26:33] quarterly at our our town hall meeting.

[26:34 - 26:36] Um, and we have a lot of broad people

[26:37 - 26:38] involved in different parts of it reporting,

[26:39 - 26:40] and there's a q and a there.

[26:40 - 26:45] Um, we, we provide, um, disclosure on our impact report, um,

[26:46 - 26:49] after our, um, engagement survey when topics come up,

[26:49 - 26:51] we create round tables where people can talk.

[26:51 - 26:53] If we feel like if it's a hotspot,

[26:53 - 26:54] we will have those moderated

[26:54 - 26:57] or facilitated, um, not by senior management,

[26:57 - 26:59] but by people in the company who are trusted.

[26:59 - 27:01] And we talk to them about how to facilitate it.

[27:02 - 27:05] Um, but we also, what we have come up with is a charter

[27:05 - 27:10] of mindful communication, which really is a way of

[27:10 - 27:12] reframing sometimes questions get asked

[27:12 - 27:13] that are not asked in a really nice way,

[27:13 - 27:15] but if you peel it back, there's a

[27:15 - 27:16] really legitimate question there.

[27:16 - 27:18] And so by putting up, whenever we have our q

[27:18 - 27:20] and a, the charter of mindful communication,

[27:20 - 27:24] which is like read the room, um, ask, ask questions

[27:24 - 27:27] that you really want answered, assume best intentions, it's,

[27:27 - 27:28] it's, you know, a few basics.

[27:28 - 27:32] Um, by doing that, um, people tend to reframe questions

[27:32 - 27:34] that could start off as hostile into construction,

[27:35 - 27:36] constructive questions, um,

[27:36 - 27:38] and other people in the room will call them out on

[27:38 - 27:40] it and say, reframe that.

[27:40 - 27:42] Um, and it'll get reframed

[27:42 - 27:44] and it leads to a, I think, a pretty healthy dialogue.

[27:44 - 27:47] What I think is really important is not shutting out avenues

[27:47 - 27:49] where these conversations happen,

[27:49 - 27:50] because they'll go underground.

[27:50 - 27:53] And I think it's really important to have your, your, um,

[27:54 - 27:56] your finger on the pulse of people's concerns.

[27:57 - 28:01] If there is, um, inequity that's half bubbling up somewhere,

[28:01 - 28:03] or if people are perceiving that something is unfair,

[28:03 - 28:05] and if you're not open to listening

[28:05 - 28:06] to it, it doesn't go away.

[28:06 - 28:09] It gets buried. And then that's when you have, um, you know,

[28:09 - 28:10] I think you end up with a workforce

[28:10 - 28:12] that doesn't really feel like you're, it's a,

[28:12 - 28:14] it's a fair place to work, huh?

[28:14 - 28:16] It used to be. Just Thank you.

[28:22 - 28:23] If you have the opportunity to speak

[28:23 - 28:25] with Jill Moore later, um, make sure to ask her

[28:25 - 28:28] for some funny stories about things like, um, refusing

[28:28 - 28:32] to sell Wiccan potions and, um, fake urine.

[28:35 - 28:38] Um, um, one of my very first responsibilities

[28:38 - 28:41] as a GC almost eight years ago, uh, was actually

[28:41 - 28:44] to help facilitate the transition of one

[28:44 - 28:47] of our male engineers, um, from male to female.

[28:48 - 28:49] And, um, this was kind of

[28:49 - 28:52] before, it was a more common thing to happen in workplaces,

[28:53 - 28:56] and it was tough to take a leadership role in those kinds

[28:56 - 28:58] of conversations, really, um,

[28:59 - 29:01] intense conversations across the organization.

[29:02 - 29:04] But they are honestly some

[29:04 - 29:06] of the most memorable conversations of my life.

[29:06 - 29:09] Like really intense conversations about what does it mean

[29:09 - 29:11] to be a man and what does it mean to be a woman.

[29:11 - 29:15] Um, and I would just really encourage you to lean in to the,

[29:15 - 29:17] to the leadership role in, um,

[29:17 - 29:20] facilitating conversations about diversity

[29:20 - 29:22] and inclusion in your organizations.

[29:23 - 29:26] So we're now gonna have a quick networking break.

[29:27 - 29:30] I understand we'll be followed by some closing remarks from,

[29:30 - 29:31] um, Kieran and Greg

[29:31 - 29:34] before we go downstairs for the closing bell this afternoon.

[29:34 - 29:36] And I just wanted to say thank you so much

[29:36 - 29:38] for letting me spend the day with you today.
