**[Speaker 1.0]**


[01:07 - 01:09] Thank you, Tara. So looking forward

[01:09 - 01:10] to this conversation tonight,

[01:10 - 01:13] and excited to have all of you guys joining us as well.

[01:13 - 01:16] My name is, as you said, is Jolie Siegel.

[01:16 - 01:18] I'm the Chief Legal Officer at C four Therapeutics,

[01:18 - 01:21] which is a company working on creating a new class of

[01:21 - 01:23] degrader medications for oncology

[01:23 - 01:25] and other, uh, therapeutic areas.

[01:26 - 01:28] And I've been with the company since June last year.

[01:29 - 01:31] I joined, uh, a couple weeks after a series B,

[01:32 - 01:35] and we immediately launched into an IPO, which closed, uh,

[01:36 - 01:37] 90 days after that.

[01:37 - 01:41] So in my first 120 days an IPO, that was interesting.

[01:42 - 01:43] Um, and since then we've gone on

[01:43 - 01:45] to get our first trial into the clinic

[01:45 - 01:47] and also do a follow on financing, uh, even

[01:47 - 01:49] before S3 eligibility.

[01:49 - 01:50] So it's been a busy and eventful year.

[01:51 - 01:53] On a personal note, on top of all that,

[01:53 - 01:55] I went on maternity leave at the end of May,

[01:55 - 01:58] so I'm finishing that up and go back to work next week.

[01:59 - 02:00] So, uh, lots of stuff going on,

[02:00 - 02:02] but did decide to tip my toes in the water

[02:02 - 02:05] with a board meeting this past week to just try

[02:05 - 02:07] and listen in 'cause I can't get enough of board dynamics.

[02:08 - 02:09] So that's sort of my background.

[02:10 - 02:13] Uh, we've got really great leadership from Fenwick with Alan

[02:13 - 02:14] and Kat on the line with us today,

[02:14 - 02:17] and they're gonna take us through a number of topics

[02:17 - 02:19] that we've thought about in terms of how to manage

[02:19 - 02:21] and get the most out of your board.

[02:22 - 02:23] Of course, as always,

[02:23 - 02:26] the best discussion come from comes from us asking questions

[02:27 - 02:29] and us sort of pushing through different scenarios

[02:29 - 02:31] and getting each other's input.

[02:31 - 02:33] So I would ask that folks, please chime in

[02:33 - 02:35] and let's make this as interactive as we possibly can.

[02:36 - 02:39] But I just wanna, you know, at the outset, thank the f team

[02:39 - 02:41] for their sponsorship, the event tonight.

[02:41 - 02:42] And I'll turn it over to Alan and Ka

[02:42 - 02:43] and let them introduce themselves.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[02:49 - 02:52] Yeah, say I'll go first. Uh, so thanks Julie.

[02:52 - 02:53] Uh, so my name is Kat Duncan.

[02:53 - 02:56] I'm a corporate partner at Fenwick and West.

[02:56 - 02:58] Um, I guess just a little bit about me first,

[02:59 - 03:01] and then I'll speak just really briefly about Fenwick.

[03:01 - 03:04] Um, so I just made a partner this year

[03:04 - 03:06] and, uh, so exciting milestone for me.

[03:07 - 03:09] Uh, and I've been at Fenwick for over 10 years.

[03:10 - 03:13] Uh, I, my practice is predominantly, uh, capital markets

[03:13 - 03:16] and working with public companies as well as working with,

[03:16 - 03:17] uh, private companies.

[03:17 - 03:19] Uh, on the public company side.

[03:19 - 03:22] I just completed taking, uh, Remitly Public.

[03:22 - 03:25] Uh, they had first day of trading last Thursday.

[03:25 - 03:28] Um, and I've worked with Alan on, uh, Redfin

[03:28 - 03:30] and Smartsheet, uh, here in the Seattle market.

[03:31 - 03:32] Uh, and then I also work

[03:32 - 03:35] with other public companies like Chegg and DocuSign.

[03:35 - 03:38] Um, on the private company side, I work with a number of,

[03:38 - 03:41] uh, later stage, uh, private companies

[03:41 - 03:42] that are in the consumer space.

[03:42 - 03:45] So like a Madison Reed, which does hair color primary kids,

[03:45 - 03:46] which does kids clothes.

[03:46 - 03:48] Uh, and I also work with a number of, uh,

[03:48 - 03:49] video gaming startups.

[03:50 - 03:54] Um, Fenwick, uh, is a firm that I'm sure, uh, I think,

[03:54 - 03:56] I think there's actually one client on the line.

[03:56 - 03:59] Uh, but we're a tech and life sciences, uh, law firm.

[03:59 - 04:03] So been around for over 50 years with, uh,

[04:03 - 04:04] presence up and down the west coast.

[04:04 - 04:07] So we've got offices in, you know, San Francisco,

[04:07 - 04:09] mountain View, Santa Monica, Seattle, as well as New York,

[04:09 - 04:12] and we're going to open a DC office as well.

[04:12 - 04:15] Um, our bread and butter is working with, uh, you know,

[04:15 - 04:18] technology and life sciences companies doing everything from

[04:18 - 04:22] corporate work, financing, employment, uh, you know,

[04:22 - 04:26] intellectual property, uh, doing licensing agreements, uh,

[04:26 - 04:29] you know, patents, litigation tax, uh, so anything

[04:29 - 04:32] and everything to service our, uh, our tech clients.

[04:33 - 04:35] So with that, I'll hand it over to Alan.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[04:36 - 04:39] Thanks. Um, I think Kat, uh, painted

[04:39 - 04:41] that picture pretty well, so there's not a lot left

[04:41 - 04:42] for me, but that's appropriate.

[04:43 - 04:45] Um, yeah, I'm, I'm both a, a practicing attorney

[04:45 - 04:47] and also I'm the chair of our corporate group.

[04:47 - 04:51] So I helped open the Seattle office for Fenwick in 2008

[04:51 - 04:54] and been practicing for about 25 years working

[04:54 - 04:57] with technology and life sciences companies of all stages.

[04:57 - 05:00] My mission is to find the next great startups, grow 'em up,

[05:00 - 05:03] help 'em raise money, go public, buy other companies,

[05:04 - 05:06] and then many of 'em get sold down the other side.

[05:06 - 05:10] I've worked with a lot of our regions, uh, leading, uh,

[05:10 - 05:12] public companies over the years.

[05:12 - 05:15] Uh, my most recent IPOs are Smartsheet

[05:15 - 05:17] and Redfin, that cat already alluded to Impel,

[05:17 - 05:19] neurop Pharma earlier this year.

[05:19 - 05:22] And, um, have had a, a, a lot

[05:22 - 05:24] of board experiences over the years, good

[05:24 - 05:26] and bad, from shareholder activism

[05:26 - 05:31] to hostile takeover defense, to board conflicts, um,

[05:32 - 05:34] you know, tricky executive terminations.

[05:35 - 05:37] So, um, we can certainly tell war stories

[05:37 - 05:39] or probably come up with scenarios

[05:39 - 05:41] and help answer your questions that you,

[05:41 - 05:42] you may have look forward to your questions.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[05:46 - 05:48] Awesome. So I think the form effort

[05:48 - 05:49] tonight, just a couple things.

[05:49 - 05:52] One, well, I have some questions that I can put to Alan

[05:52 - 05:54] and Kat that we can go through, but

[05:54 - 05:56] before we do that, we'll follow through on our usual format

[05:56 - 05:58] of doing introductions.

[05:58 - 06:00] So I, I've given my introduction, we'll ask folks

[06:00 - 06:02] to introduce themselves, give a second

[06:02 - 06:04] or two on who their, what their company is,

[06:04 - 06:07] and then one challenge that you're currently facing, uh,

[06:07 - 06:09] bonus points if it ties into our topic

[06:09 - 06:10] of board matters today.

[06:11 - 06:13] So I'll give you my one challenge that I'm thinking about.

[06:14 - 06:18] You know, we've got a, um, ex a an engaged board

[06:18 - 06:20] of directors, but we don't have, uh, a lot

[06:20 - 06:22] of public company director experience on our board.

[06:23 - 06:25] So thinking about how to keep our board

[06:25 - 06:28] as well educated about what's topical and important today

[06:28 - 06:31] and what investors are expecting from directors is something

[06:31 - 06:32] that I'm always thinking about.

[06:33 - 06:36] And I'll turn over, I'm gonna go on my screen to Christine,

[06:36 - 06:37] who's first one up for me.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[06:38 - 06:39] Hi, everybody. Good evening.

[06:40 - 06:42] Um, happy to, to join this group.

[06:43 - 06:45] Um, so I just joined at Fire

[06:45 - 06:48] as its first general council, uh, three weeks ago.

[06:48 - 06:52] And we have our first, uh, board meeting coming up.

[06:52 - 06:53] Well, I should, I should say,

[06:53 - 06:55] I have my first board meeting coming up the first

[06:55 - 06:56] week of October.

[06:56 - 06:59] So this topic is very timely for me.

[06:59 - 07:02] Uh, previous to at fire, I was general counsel at Acquia.

[07:03 - 07:04] I was there for eight years.

[07:04 - 07:06] Um, so it's, it's nice to see all of you

[07:06 - 07:08] and I, I look forward to the discussion.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[07:12 - 07:14] And Christine, why don't you pick somebody

[07:14 - 07:15] and we'll just keep passing it around.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[07:16 - 07:19] Uh, so yeah, I'll, I'll pass the baton to, I think Kat is

[07:19 - 07:20] to the right of my screen.

[07:21 - 07:24] Oh, no, sorry. That's, uh, Fenwick. Sorry. Uh, it's Karen.

[07:24 - 07:25] Hi, Karen.

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[07:27 - 07:29] Hi, I'm Karen Tepi chain.

[07:29 - 07:32] Um, I am general counsel at Ginkgo Bioworks.

[07:33 - 07:35] Um, we're a biotechnology company

[07:35 - 07:37] where we're building a platform

[07:37 - 07:41] to program cells like you can program computers.

[07:41 - 07:44] Um, and we also have a COVID-19 testing, um,

[07:45 - 07:47] uh, you know, business unit.

[07:47 - 07:52] Uh, so we recently completed, um, a business combination

[07:52 - 07:56] with a spac, so we're now a public company as

[07:56 - 07:57] of September 16th.

[07:57 - 08:00] So I think our board issues, um,

[08:00 - 08:03] that we're facing is really like, you know,

[08:03 - 08:06] how do we move from being this private company board

[08:06 - 08:10] where really, like a lot of the executive team had, um,

[08:11 - 08:15] ownership and, um, decision making authority over lots

[08:15 - 08:18] of the different kinds of transactions we do to

[08:18 - 08:22] how do you like, create like, um, solid governance, um, uh,

[08:22 - 08:25] a solid governance and a solid relationship with the board,

[08:25 - 08:28] um, to efficiently continue business as we have done it.

**[Speaker 6.0]**


[08:33 - 08:35] So I'm another Karen, I wasn't sure

[08:35 - 08:36] which Karen you were calling out.

[08:36 - 08:39] So I'll, um,

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[08:39 - 08:40] Hi Karen.

**[Speaker 6.0]**


[08:40 - 08:42] I'm Karen Galley. I'm, um,

[08:42 - 08:44] general Counsel at Ika America Pharmaceutical.

[08:44 - 08:46] I am new to Tech gc. This is my first event.

[08:47 - 08:51] Um, Ika is a, um, pharmaceutical company.

[08:51 - 08:53] We're also in, um, the digital space.

[08:53 - 08:57] We have the first FDA, um, product approved,

[08:57 - 09:00] which is a chip in a pill, um, called Abilify, my site.

[09:00 - 09:03] Um, and we're looking at other digital opportunities.

[09:03 - 09:06] So that prompted me to join, um, challenge.

[09:06 - 09:08] So, so we're privately held.

[09:08 - 09:12] We just had our, our parent company in Japan just kicked off

[09:12 - 09:15] our 100th year celebration or hundredth anniversary year.

[09:15 - 09:18] So, you know, we're well established

[09:18 - 09:20] and not seeking funding.

[09:20 - 09:21] And so I think I'm in a different space,

[09:21 - 09:23] or I'm handling different issues

[09:23 - 09:25] than many of you on the call.

[09:25 - 09:26] But, um, one of the challenges that we have is

[09:26 - 09:28] because we're privately held and we're long standing,

[09:28 - 09:31] our board is very known to us.

[09:32 - 09:33] Um, and we are working on expanding that

[09:33 - 09:36] and going through the process of identifying potential

[09:36 - 09:39] candidates and, um, you know,

[09:39 - 09:41] looking more for different voices.

[09:44 - 09:46] Um, so I am gonna call Efrin.

**[Speaker 7.0]**


[09:49 - 09:50] Good evening everyone. My name's Fen Garcia.

[09:51 - 09:54] I'm A-C-L-O-C-C-O here at Southwest Key Programs.

[09:55 - 09:56] Uh, before I tell you about what Southwest Key does,

[09:57 - 09:59] I actually started off as a patent litigator, uh,

[09:59 - 10:00] which is the reason I joined Tech tc.

[10:00 - 10:01] I wanna stay close to my roots.

[10:01 - 10:04] Uh, did patent litigation for 10 years

[10:04 - 10:06] before joining a smog company here in Austin, uh,

[10:07 - 10:10] software slash IT company, and did a, was their GC

[10:10 - 10:12] and their, uh, VP

[10:12 - 10:14] of community resources for five, six years.

[10:15 - 10:16] Uh, then had an interesting opportunity

[10:16 - 10:18] to join the current organization where I'm at.

[10:18 - 10:22] It's, uh, 8,000 strong, uh, organization, uh,

[10:22 - 10:25] employee strong organization that serves about 5,000

[10:25 - 10:27] unaccompanied minors at any given time.

[10:27 - 10:30] Uh, so it's a, it's a very unique organization

[10:31 - 10:34] and, uh, like I said, I joined Tech DC too

[10:34 - 10:37] 'cause I do still enjoy the technical aspects of, of law.

[10:37 - 10:39] Uh, one of the biggest issues I was brought on board

[10:39 - 10:41] for many reasons, but the biggest is kind

[10:41 - 10:43] of transformed the organization, uh, from the inside out.

[10:43 - 10:45] And one of the biggest issues that I've encountered is

[10:46 - 10:47] a board that is, uh,

[10:48 - 10:51] some legacy board members had causes some heartburn.

[10:51 - 10:55] And so trying to gently ask them to, Hey,

[10:55 - 10:56] you might wanna look somewhere else.

[10:56 - 10:59] And so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on how to

[11:00 - 11:01] transform a board, uh,

[11:01 - 11:04] when board members may be reticent to leave.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[11:08 - 11:09] All right. Who are you calling on next?

**[Speaker 7.0]**


[11:11 - 11:13] Uh, Dustin Carlton.

**[Speaker 8.0]**


[11:16 - 11:17] Hey, how's everybody doing?

[11:17 - 11:20] Uh, as he mentioned Dustin Carlton. I'm from Bellhop.

[11:21 - 11:23] I'm the VP of Legal and Compliance.

[11:24 - 11:26] I've been at the company for about three years.

[11:26 - 11:27] I'm in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

[11:28 - 11:32] Um, one of the reasons why I'm here at this, um,

[11:33 - 11:35] dinner seminar, um,

[11:36 - 11:39] is I don't actually have a corporate background.

[11:39 - 11:42] I was, uh, labor and employment, uh, prior

[11:42 - 11:43] to going in-house.

[11:44 - 11:48] And, um, so I'm always feeling like I'm ill-equipped, uh,

[11:48 - 11:51] to some extent, um, in the boardroom.

[11:52 - 11:54] So I think it's just helpful to surround myself

[11:54 - 11:58] as much education as possible on, on, uh, board matters.

[11:59 - 12:03] And one of the, well, there's a lot of issues, of course,

[12:03 - 12:06] running around, um, the company.

[12:06 - 12:09] But, um, you know,

[12:09 - 12:11] next year we'll be seeking some additional funding

[12:11 - 12:15] and I'm, I'm looking for additional ways just to better, um,

[12:17 - 12:20] equip the, the company going into our, our next fundraise.

[12:21 - 12:23] Um, so both with respect to the board

[12:23 - 12:25] and with respect to the just general company matters.

[12:28 - 12:32] And I'll call on, uh, Robin.

[12:32 - 12:34] No, I think you went, didn't you?

[12:38 - 12:39] No, I haven't said any Yet.

[12:39 - 12:40] Okay. I didn't have your name written down.

**[Speaker 9.0]**


[12:41 - 12:44] I was like, wait. That's okay. That's alright.

[12:44 - 12:47] Um, I'm general counsel for a company called Token X

[12:48 - 12:51] and we tokenize sensitive data.

[12:51 - 12:54] So, um, structured and semi-structured.

[12:55 - 12:58] Um, it could be, um, bank account numbers,

[12:58 - 13:01] social security numbers, phone numbers, credit card numbers,

[13:02 - 13:07] um, started out, um, as a PCI compliance solution,

[13:08 - 13:09] but it's gotten broader than that.

[13:10 - 13:14] And in our company, we're a, you know, compared to you guys

[13:14 - 13:17] with 8,000 employees, we're a very small tech company,

[13:18 - 13:20] but right in the middle of due diligence

[13:20 - 13:21] for a round of funding.

[13:22 - 13:25] And so, um, like Dustin said,

[13:26 - 13:29] I don't have a heavy corporate governance

[13:29 - 13:30] background and exposure.

[13:31 - 13:35] I have a heavy tech contracting, et cetera, et cetera,

[13:35 - 13:38] liaison with technical people background,

[13:39 - 13:43] and our board, um, I suspect it's about to change

[13:43 - 13:44] with another round of funding.

[13:45 - 13:48] And, um, it's one of those situations

[13:48 - 13:51] where I haven't had any exposure to our board,

[13:52 - 13:53] but they know that, uh,

[13:53 - 13:55] our leadership team knows that I would like that.

[13:56 - 13:59] And so I'm kind of preparing for the day that all

[13:59 - 14:00] of a sudden they flip the switch on

[14:00 - 14:03] and say, oh, okay, well now how about you come over here.

[14:04 - 14:06] Our former general counsel is a shareholder

[14:06 - 14:08] and he is on the board.

[14:09 - 14:10] So, um, there's,

[14:10 - 14:15] and he's been there from day one, so, um,

[14:15 - 14:17] that's why I am not involved in the board at this time.

[14:19 - 14:23] And let's see. And who hasn't gone yet?

[14:25 - 14:29] Um, how about Renee Hunter?

**[Speaker 10.0]**


[14:32 - 14:35] I was getting nervous I was gonna be the last picked, uh,

[14:35 - 14:37] it felt like I was back in kickball in elementary school.

[14:38 - 14:40] Uh, so Renee Hunter with Notarize, uh,

[14:40 - 14:43] we provide remote online notarization services, uh,

[14:43 - 14:47] in addition to identity proofing services, uh, as well

[14:47 - 14:50] as active software as a service for companies

[14:50 - 14:52] who wanna bring their own notaries on the platform

[14:52 - 14:55] and provide their own remote noter services.

[14:55 - 15:00] So, um, not as streamlined as initially thought.

[15:00 - 15:02] I joined notarized from the Quicken

[15:02 - 15:03] Loans family of companies.

[15:03 - 15:06] I have been part of every, uh, the passing

[15:06 - 15:09] of every single remote notarization law except

[15:10 - 15:11] for Virginia in 2011.

[15:12 - 15:15] Um, so since 2016 have been working with legislators

[15:15 - 15:20] and regulators and, uh, setting forth new legislation.

[15:20 - 15:22] That being said, I say that

[15:22 - 15:25] because that is where I, whether I should admit

[15:25 - 15:26] that's my area of expertise

[15:26 - 15:28] or not, that's my area of expertise.

[15:28 - 15:30] Um, working with a board,

[15:30 - 15:32] even though I was general counsel at my past company,

[15:32 - 15:33] we were privately held

[15:33 - 15:36] and it was a very different scenario at the time.

[15:37 - 15:39] So wanting to learn more about how to work better

[15:39 - 15:42] with the board, and quite honestly, how do you kick some,

[15:42 - 15:43] some of the extra observers

[15:43 - 15:46] and like visitors off the board when they just keep showing

[15:46 - 15:48] up to the meeting and do it politely.

[15:48 - 15:50] Like, if you only have one observer seat,

[15:50 - 15:52] you should only bring one person, not three.

[15:52 - 15:54] So I love to hear how some of you have handled

[15:54 - 15:56] that in the past, and maybe it's just as blunt

[15:56 - 15:57] as you can't all come.

[15:58 - 16:00] This is a not a 17 person meeting.

[16:06 - 16:10] I'm next. Um, David Morris, did you speak yet?

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[16:11 - 16:13] No, not yet. Uh, hey, uh, David Morris,

[16:13 - 16:15] general Counsel for Vivid Seats.

[16:15 - 16:18] Vivid Seats is an online ticketing marketplace

[16:18 - 16:20] for live sports concert and event tickets.

[16:21 - 16:25] And we are in the midst of going public over the next couple

[16:25 - 16:27] of weeks through a SPAC process.

[16:28 - 16:31] Just had our S four declared effective.

[16:31 - 16:34] So we're just a couple weeks behind, uh, Karen, where?

[16:34 - 16:36] Karen, Karen TI should say.

[16:37 - 16:41] Um, so my background is kind of corporate transactional,

[16:41 - 16:43] but not on the governance side.

[16:43 - 16:46] So for me, coming into a new public company board,

[16:47 - 16:49] putting all of our governance in place,

[16:49 - 16:52] and I came in kind of halfway through the SPAC process,

[16:53 - 16:56] trying to learn as much as I can about setting the right

[16:57 - 17:00] standards, uh, and processes upfront, since I have a chance

[17:00 - 17:02] to do this from scratch, as most

[17:02 - 17:04] of our private company board is not part

[17:04 - 17:06] of the public company board going forward.

[17:09 - 17:12] Uh, let's see, who else has not gone yet?

[17:12 - 17:15] How about Steven, have you gone yet?

**[Speaker 12.0]**


[17:15 - 17:18] No, I have not. Thank you. Uh, my name is Steven Quinlan.

[17:18 - 17:21] I'm head of legal for Boston Gene Corporation.

[17:21 - 17:23] Uh, what we do is we own

[17:23 - 17:28] and use proprietary software, um, to analyze sequencing data

[17:28 - 17:31] for, um, tissue specimens of cancer for,

[17:31 - 17:33] to assist oncologists and treatment decisions.

[17:34 - 17:37] Um, and so we're a relatively small company.

[17:37 - 17:40] The board is just three members right now, one investor

[17:40 - 17:45] who we brought on as part of our Series A financing, um,

[17:45 - 17:49] and essentially, um, other, uh, founders of the company.

[17:50 - 17:52] Um, but we will be seeking investment soon.

[17:52 - 17:55] And so one of the major hurdles that, you know,

[17:55 - 17:57] we'll be facing in the near future is how

[17:57 - 17:59] to really professionalize, um,

[17:59 - 18:04] and I guess level up the board, uh, for the purpose of the,

[18:05 - 18:06] um, new investors that will be brought in

[18:06 - 18:09] and the kind of oversight that we'll be anticipating.

[18:10 - 18:13] Um, so I guess I'll move on here.

[18:13 - 18:16] I has Rachel Goldwasser gone

[18:16 - 18:20] yet. Okay. I

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[18:20 - 18:22] Haven't, let me just fum fumble for the mute button.

[18:23 - 18:26] Um, Um,

[18:27 - 18:29] I am the, uh, GC

[18:29 - 18:32] and VP for regulatory at Key Capture Energy.

[18:32 - 18:36] We're, um, a little different than some tech GC companies.

[18:36 - 18:38] We, um, build and then operate, um,

[18:39 - 18:41] big batteries on the electric grid

[18:42 - 18:44] and, um, we're privately held, um,

[18:45 - 18:49] and just announced a couple weeks ago that we are going

[18:49 - 18:52] to be acquired by a Korean conglomerate.

[18:53 - 18:55] Um, so we're gonna, we're in a similar place

[18:55 - 18:57] to some other folks, although we aren't

[18:57 - 18:58] gonna be public in that.

[18:58 - 19:01] I'm thinking through what our, um,

[19:01 - 19:03] manager's relationships will be

[19:03 - 19:07] and what kinds of approvals they're expecting to have

[19:07 - 19:10] and what's gonna, what is gonna change in terms

[19:10 - 19:12] of the processes that we followed.

[19:13 - 19:16] I joined the company almost two years ago and, um, the CEO

[19:16 - 19:19] and COO had a pretty well established relationship

[19:19 - 19:20] with their current investors.

[19:21 - 19:24] And so I've played a pretty light role in terms

[19:24 - 19:27] of making sure as an l you know, as an LLC with a small

[19:28 - 19:30] manage, you know, group of managers.

[19:30 - 19:34] Pretty limited role in terms of, um, guiding them, um,

[19:34 - 19:37] in corporate, um, structure and governance.

[19:37 - 19:40] But I think that in this next round of relationships,

[19:41 - 19:43] those items are gonna be much more important.

[19:43 - 19:45] So really interested in, in the conversation

[19:45 - 19:47] and hearing about people's experience.

[19:48 - 19:52] Um, Meredith, have you, have you introduced yourself?

[19:52 - 19:53] I don't think you have.

**[Speaker 14.0]**


[19:54 - 19:57] No. Hi, I am Meredith Fuchs. I'm General Counsel Plaid.

[19:57 - 20:01] We're, uh, a financial services, um,

[20:01 - 20:03] technology infrastructure company.

[20:04 - 20:06] And, um, I'm interested in many

[20:06 - 20:08] of the topics people have raised.

[20:08 - 20:11] Um, I'd say probably one

[20:11 - 20:13] of the things I'm thinking about is kind

[20:13 - 20:17] of transitioning from a mainly investor, um,

[20:17 - 20:21] populated board to one that's, um, got independent,

[20:22 - 20:25] uh, directors and sort of the kind of reporting

[20:25 - 20:29] and expectations to, to kind of get the board to

[20:29 - 20:30] where they will, you know,

[20:30 - 20:32] they should be if we were a public company.

[20:33 - 20:34] But, um, many of these topics are

[20:34 - 20:36] very interesting, so thank you.

[20:37 - 20:38] Oh, I'm supposed to pick someone.

[20:39 - 20:42] Um, let's see.

[20:44 - 20:46] Diana, Diane, did you hear

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[20:46 - 20:47] Her? Diana, that's me, yes.

[20:47 - 20:50] Hi everyone. I'm, I'm Diane ui.

[20:50 - 20:51] I'm general counsel of ezCater.

[20:52 - 20:54] ezCater is an online marketplace

[20:54 - 20:56] for ordering corporate catering.

[20:57 - 20:59] We're a private VC-backed company.

[21:00 - 21:03] Uh, board currently consists of eight members, a couple

[21:03 - 21:06] of founders, couple of independents

[21:06 - 21:09] and four investors as well as, uh, a couple

[21:09 - 21:14] of board observers where potentially, um,

[21:14 - 21:16] going public in a year or two.

[21:16 - 21:17] Nothing currently on the horizon,

[21:18 - 21:20] but, um, starting to think about that

[21:20 - 21:21] and trying to think about

[21:21 - 21:24] what we would wanna be doing from a,

[21:24 - 21:26] a board perspective in connection with that.

[21:26 - 21:29] I do have a, a, a general corporate background, uh,

[21:29 - 21:32] was previously at a company called care.com

[21:33 - 21:36] and took that company public in 2014, uh,

[21:36 - 21:37] and continued there for

[21:37 - 21:38] another five years as a public company.

[21:39 - 21:43] So, uh, I have experience, uh, with public company boards

[21:43 - 21:44] and what the requirements are,

[21:44 - 21:46] but thought a refresher would be, would be good.

[21:51 - 21:53] So, I'm sorry I joined late, so I don't know

[21:53 - 21:56] who has not gone yet.

[21:56 - 21:58] Just can anyone raise their hand if they haven't gone?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[21:59 - 22:01] I think it's rake an anshu, right?

[22:01 - 22:05] If I got pronunciations right and Sarah,

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[22:05 - 22:06] Okay. Okay.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[22:11 - 22:13] I can go if no one will volunteer.

[22:14 - 22:17] Hey guys, I'm general counsel

[22:17 - 22:20] and corporate secretary for Aztec Industries Inc.

[22:21 - 22:22] Uh, we are a public company.

[22:24 - 22:27] We are sort of an old dumb company, uh,

[22:28 - 22:31] but trying to heavily invest in technology

[22:32 - 22:35] and, uh, sort of follow the adage, right?

[22:35 - 22:37] You are either a tech company,

[22:37 - 22:40] you are either turning into a tech company

[22:40 - 22:41] or being replaced by a tech company.

[22:42 - 22:43] So we are trying to not be replaced

[22:44 - 22:46] and hopefully turn into a tech company.

[22:47 - 22:51] Um, like I said, we've been a public company.

[22:51 - 22:53] We've actually been a public company for, um,

[22:55 - 22:57] I wanna say about 40 years.

[22:58 - 22:59] But, but therein lies a little bit of the rub.

[23:00 - 23:03] Um, our company has only had

[23:04 - 23:06] two CEOs before the current CEO

[23:07 - 23:09] and both of those CEOs were sort of the,

[23:09 - 23:11] one was the founder owner, the other was his son.

[23:12 - 23:16] So the board members sort of,

[23:17 - 23:20] I think if you look at, um,

[23:22 - 23:25] look at a lot of, you know, literature on boards, you know,

[23:26 - 23:29] um, and if you sort of did the, the cature

[23:29 - 23:32] of old school board, that would be our board.

[23:32 - 23:35] You can go and take a look at our website.

[23:36 - 23:40] Um, we are going through a transformation of our board,

[23:41 - 23:45] or the next three years we'll be transitioning six members,

[23:46 - 23:48] um, and working with Nam

[23:48 - 23:52] and gut chair to sort of, um, action the plan in place,

[23:53 - 23:56] help the CEO, um, we,

[23:56 - 23:58] the new board member candidates and so on and so forth.

[23:58 - 24:00] So that's sort of my role.

[24:00 - 24:05] Um, my background is, uh, sort

[24:05 - 24:08] of a little bit of mostly corporate, uh,

[24:08 - 24:10] started my career early on with public company m

[24:10 - 24:13] and a, then worked on private m and a,

[24:14 - 24:18] and then went, um, to, uh, to a Midwest based,

[24:18 - 24:22] uh, law firm doing both middle market m

[24:22 - 24:27] and a as well as corporate, um, corporate, um, uh,

[24:27 - 24:29] transactional work, um,

[24:29 - 24:31] commercial agreements and stuff like that.

[24:31 - 24:33] So that's what brought me,

[24:34 - 24:36] or those experiences sort of brought me here.

[24:36 - 24:40] Now, um, with that, I'll pass it on to

[24:41 - 24:42] if I got the pronunciation right.

**[Speaker 17.0]**


[24:45 - 24:48] You did. Thank you. Um, hi, my name is Rika Rin.

[24:49 - 24:52] I am currently the general counsel of a Susu Financial.

[24:53 - 24:57] Um, a Susu Financial is a FinTech company that is,

[24:57 - 25:02] um, that is dedicated to using data to bridge the wealth,

[25:02 - 25:03] the racial wealth gap in America.

[25:04 - 25:05] One of our key products right now

[25:05 - 25:09] that we're really scaling up on is rent reporting, um,

[25:10 - 25:12] for tenants and multifamily properties.

[25:13 - 25:16] Um, we started off with like a B2C model.

[25:16 - 25:19] Now we're a B2B model really working with, um, property

[25:20 - 25:24] managers and owner operators to sign on their residents

[25:24 - 25:29] to report positive, um, rental payment history in order to,

[25:29 - 25:32] um, create credit scores so people are credit invisible

[25:32 - 25:36] and to boost credit scores for people who don't, um, who,

[25:36 - 25:38] who currently have fair to good credit.

[25:38 - 25:42] Right? Um, we're pretty small company.

[25:42 - 25:43] I'm the first general council.

[25:43 - 25:48] We just, um, earlier this summer closed our series a fin,

[25:48 - 25:52] um, finance, um, financing round, um, a funding round.

[25:53 - 25:55] We are, we just had our first board meeting.

[25:55 - 25:58] That was the first one I've ever, um, participated in

[25:59 - 26:00] as corporate secretary.

[26:00 - 26:04] Um, learning a lot, took meeting notes. That was fun.

[26:04 - 26:08] Um, so I think what I'm, really think what I'm considering

[26:08 - 26:12] as we, um, are as we start talking about, um, you know,

[26:12 - 26:15] later funding series is just looking at like the bylaws.

[26:15 - 26:20] And my challenge is trying to, you know, the board was, uh,

[26:20 - 26:24] initially comprised of the co uh, the co-founders

[26:25 - 26:27] and now we're getting investors on the board.

[26:27 - 26:29] And initially a lot

[26:29 - 26:31] of the powers are seated at the board level.

[26:31 - 26:33] And just, you know, having an understanding of how

[26:33 - 26:36] to like balance what's, like what we should,

[26:36 - 26:39] what we should go to a corporate, like to go

[26:39 - 26:40] to the executive level, right?

[26:40 - 26:43] Powers that should be seated to the executive sources, um,

[26:43 - 26:45] powers that should be seated to the board.

[26:45 - 26:46] So if any kind of insight

[26:46 - 26:47] into that would be extremely helpful.

[26:48 - 26:49] And last, but certainly not least,

[26:50 - 26:51] um, I hand it over to Sarah.

**[Speaker 19.0]**


[26:54 - 26:56] Hi. Uh, if you see people walking

[26:56 - 26:57] around in the background, sorry about that

[26:58 - 26:59] center time over here.

[27:00 - 27:01] Uh, my name is Sarah Weatherhead.

[27:01 - 27:04] I'm the general counsel at Maven Clinic, and we are a family

[27:04 - 27:07] and, um, maternity health

[27:08 - 27:12] telehealth product, a platform, um, sold primarily

[27:12 - 27:14] through employers, but also, um,

[27:14 - 27:16] more recently through health plans.

[27:16 - 27:21] Um, and, um, I have to say

[27:21 - 27:22] that in listening

[27:22 - 27:24] to everyone's comments on their board questions,

[27:24 - 27:26] we are Series D by the way,

[27:26 - 27:27] we just closed our Series D this summer.

[27:28 - 27:29] Um, I have to say that in listening

[27:29 - 27:34] to people's comments on boards, I think one thing that, um,

[27:34 - 27:37] I was reminded of that I have questions about is this is the

[27:37 - 27:40] earliest stage company I've ever been with.

[27:40 - 27:43] Um, I've been with, you know, much, I've been

[27:43 - 27:46] with public companies in earlier phases of my career

[27:46 - 27:51] where I have some corporate experience, um, with disclosures

[27:51 - 27:53] and filings as well as, you know, some exposure

[27:53 - 27:55] to the board, but not a ton

[27:55 - 27:57] because I was not the general counsel at that time.

[27:57 - 28:00] So I've never been the general counsel, um, dealing

[28:00 - 28:01] with a public company board.

[28:02 - 28:04] So, um, I guess one of the things I,

[28:04 - 28:08] I wonder about is in doing our latest round, um, I learned

[28:08 - 28:12] that the choice of the investors was related to,

[28:13 - 28:15] um, the current, uh, board

[28:15 - 28:19] and CEO's kind of thoughts on

[28:19 - 28:21] who might be best as a director.

[28:22 - 28:25] Um, we were oversubscribed as in many, um,

[28:25 - 28:26] digital health situations.

[28:26 - 28:30] And I think, um, as happens as commonly happens, you know,

[28:30 - 28:31] the choosing the choice

[28:31 - 28:35] of which investors can sometimes be connected to

[28:36 - 28:39] what their presence on the board might mean.

[28:39 - 28:42] And so I'm interested in hearing from both Fenwick

[28:42 - 28:44] and colleagues as to

[28:44 - 28:46] what their experience has been in that arena.

[28:46 - 28:49] As well as, um, managing the board from a general counsel

[28:49 - 28:53] perspective, particularly if you come in, um, at any time,

[28:53 - 28:55] say post series A

[28:55 - 28:58] and there have already been board, you know, directors there

[28:58 - 29:00] for a while, have a relationship with the CEO

[29:00 - 29:04] and what that means for the GC in terms of influence

[29:04 - 29:05] with the board and what kind

[29:05 - 29:07] of independent relationship one can have

[29:07 - 29:12] with the board when the, the CEO, you know, is, is in charge

[29:12 - 29:15] and, and has had a longer relationship with those directors.

[29:15 - 29:17] So interested in hearing a bit about that as well.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[29:19 - 29:21] Thanks, Sarah. And then Joanna,

[29:21 - 29:22] I think we have, we have you on our list.

**[Speaker 19.0]**


[29:24 - 29:29] Yes. Last but not least, Go next. Sorry.

**[Speaker 18.0]**


[29:30 - 29:34] I'm the, uh, um, uh, CLO

[29:34 - 29:36] and SVP of NEO Systems,

[29:36 - 29:39] and we provide back office, um, solutions

[29:39 - 29:44] for government contractors, um, hosting cybersecurity, um,

[29:45 - 29:48] managed cybersecurity accounting services, um,

[29:48 - 29:52] human capital management, um, and financial planning

[29:52 - 29:54] and analysis, um, uh, for,

[29:54 - 29:55] for not just government contractors,

[29:55 - 30:00] but highly regulated, um, industries such

[30:00 - 30:01] as nonprofits and so forth.

[30:02 - 30:07] Um, and the challenge we're currently facing is we were

[30:07 - 30:09] just, we are recently acquired by,

[30:09 - 30:10] um, a private equity firm.

[30:11 - 30:13] And so our whole board has been replaced

[30:13 - 30:14] except for the founders.

[30:15 - 30:16] They remain on,

[30:16 - 30:20] but we have the investors on the board, um, now as well.

[30:20 - 30:24] And so this is a very timely, uh,

[30:25 - 30:27] session, uh, for, for our company.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[30:31 - 30:32] Awesome. Thank you. And do we have,

[30:32 - 30:34] have we done introductions for everyone?

[30:34 - 30:35] Craig, did we get you?

**[Speaker 20.0]**


[30:36 - 30:38] No, you didn't. Sorry, I had to jump off. Uh, hi everyone.

[30:38 - 30:43] Craig Siegel. Uh, I am, uh, CLO at, uh, Hootsuite.

[30:43 - 30:45] Uh, I'm located in Toronto.

[30:45 - 30:49] Uh, Hootsuite is, uh, a social media management platform,

[30:49 - 30:53] so assists, uh, businesses with, uh, social marketing,

[30:53 - 30:56] social commerce, uh, 1200 employees.

[30:57 - 31:02] Um, our board is made up of, uh, essentially, uh, founder

[31:02 - 31:05] and, and, uh, investor, uh, nominees.

[31:06 - 31:08] Uh, we are looking at a, a bunch of different opportunities

[31:09 - 31:12] that, uh, could impact the, uh, the makeup of the board,

[31:12 - 31:15] essentially potentially looking to move to more

[31:15 - 31:16] of an independent board.

[31:16 - 31:18] Uh, about a year, year

[31:18 - 31:22] and a half ago, we moved from a founder, CEO, uh, who, uh,

[31:22 - 31:25] interest was, uh, not, uh, not that much into,

[31:26 - 31:27] uh, heavy governance.

[31:27 - 31:30] And we've moved into a, uh, essentially a professional CEO

[31:30 - 31:33] where governance is absolutely at the forefront.

[31:33 - 31:35] So it's a bit of a continuum in terms of, uh,

[31:35 - 31:37] strengthening our, uh, governance program.

[31:38 - 31:39] So, uh, looking forward to the conversation.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[31:41 - 31:44] Awesome. Well really appreciate everybody giving some

[31:44 - 31:45] context and background on where they are.

[31:46 - 31:47] I'll jump in with the first question,

[31:47 - 31:50] but folks, please plan to jump in and help me out

[31:50 - 31:51] 'cause no one wants to just hear my questions.

[31:52 - 31:53] Uh, one of the things that, that resonated

[31:53 - 31:55] with me in listening to everybody

[31:55 - 31:58] and their questions tonight is about the evolving role

[31:58 - 32:00] of a board of directors over the lifecycle of a company.

[32:01 - 32:02] If I think about my CEO,

[32:03 - 32:05] he talks about the board having a responsibility

[32:05 - 32:07] to deliver foresight, oversight, and insight.

[32:08 - 32:10] And, you know, different people can deliver

[32:10 - 32:11] different parts of that, perhaps.

[32:12 - 32:14] Certainly the role of the board changes when you're talking

[32:14 - 32:16] about an early stage startup company all

[32:16 - 32:18] the way through a public company.

[32:18 - 32:21] And so, Kat and Ellen, I'm curious as to how would you

[32:21 - 32:24] recommend folks like us think about the board and its role

[32:24 - 32:26] and how to interact

[32:26 - 32:27] with them most effectively based on those

[32:27 - 32:29] different stages of life?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[32:32 - 32:34] Yeah, I'll jump in.

[32:34 - 32:36] I mean, I, I think you start out as a,

[32:36 - 32:39] a newly formed company with a founder, two founders,

[32:39 - 32:41] they're on the board, and,

[32:41 - 32:44] and there's a first step which involves some level

[32:44 - 32:45] of giving up control, right?

[32:45 - 32:47] And that's a, that's a big moment.

[32:47 - 32:50] You take money from someone outside, um,

[32:50 - 32:51] your board immediately changes.

[32:51 - 32:52] It's not just your company anymore.

[32:52 - 32:55] You've gotta, um, even if it,

[32:55 - 32:56] even if they don't have control of the board,

[32:57 - 32:59] most things are done by consensus at that level.

[32:59 - 33:01] And you need to bring someone along with you,

[33:01 - 33:03] you need to report to them.

[33:03 - 33:06] So board meetings become professionalized.

[33:06 - 33:10] You're, um, you're preparing materials in advance,

[33:10 - 33:13] you're taking criticism and input.

[33:13 - 33:17] Um, I think some people alluded to the importance

[33:17 - 33:18] of who you recruit.

[33:19 - 33:21] And Julie, I liked your, your, um,

[33:21 - 33:23] I'm not sure I can repeat it, your foresight, oversight,

[33:24 - 33:25] and insight.

[33:25 - 33:28] Was it, um, that that's where I think foresight

[33:28 - 33:31] and insight are most important at that stage.

[33:31 - 33:35] Perhaps, um, you know, you a board member

[33:35 - 33:38] that is also an investor that can come in

[33:38 - 33:40] and has, has been there with other companies

[33:40 - 33:43] and can see, you know, what the, what the dials are

[33:43 - 33:45] for your company to help take it to the next level

[33:46 - 33:48] to prepare it for its next fundraising round to go

[33:48 - 33:52] to market, um, to, to penetrate customer bases

[33:52 - 33:53] that you haven't before.

[33:54 - 33:57] Um, I think the board at that stage is, is doing a lot more,

[33:58 - 34:02] um, senior experience, business advice

[34:02 - 34:06] and strategy advice than they are governance and oversight.

[34:06 - 34:08] You know, the governance and oversight happens from your,

[34:09 - 34:14] your, your contractual documents, your, um, the rules

[34:14 - 34:16] and, and the fact that there's no more money coming if,

[34:16 - 34:18] if you don't do, do your job right

[34:18 - 34:20] and please your investors along the way.

[34:21 - 34:25] Um, oftentimes at that stage, a board will have a, a,

[34:26 - 34:28] an empty seat for an independent director.

[34:28 - 34:30] You know, I often see this kind of board of five,

[34:31 - 34:34] two founders, two um, two investors,

[34:35 - 34:36] and a fifth player to be named later

[34:36 - 34:38] that's gonna be an independent director.

[34:39 - 34:42] You know, I think that that independent director can be

[34:42 - 34:45] worth their weight in gold if they are really a contributor.

[34:45 - 34:50] So, um, companies often wait a long time to find them.

[34:50 - 34:52] You gotta pay them usually, um, if you want 'em

[34:52 - 34:54] to, to do good work.

[34:54 - 34:56] Um, if you move too quickly

[34:56 - 34:59] and get the wrong person, I think you can, you can pay

[34:59 - 35:01] for something that doesn't add value or worse.

[35:01 - 35:04] You can, you can, you can pay for a director that really is,

[35:05 - 35:07] you know, closely tied to your investors

[35:07 - 35:08] and isn't truly independent.

[35:09 - 35:13] Um, but when you find that, um, industry expert, um,

[35:14 - 35:15] that is truly independent from you

[35:16 - 35:20] and independent from your investors, um, the value

[35:20 - 35:25] that they bring when there's a real problem, um, is,

[35:25 - 35:27] is immense, right?

[35:27 - 35:30] I mean, um, when things are going well up into the right,

[35:31 - 35:32] what the board votes are,

[35:32 - 35:35] doesn't matter when there's conflict

[35:35 - 35:36] and there's disagreement

[35:37 - 35:40] or there's gonna be recapitalizations, restructurings,

[35:40 - 35:43] layoffs, whatever it might be, executive changes.

[35:44 - 35:49] Um, having a steady hand that is independent from purely

[35:49 - 35:51] investor financial incentives and purely management

[35:52 - 35:54] compensation incentives, but can help you think through that

[35:54 - 35:57] and lead through it is, is really valuable.

[35:58 - 36:01] Um, so I think searching for, for someone at that stage

[36:01 - 36:04] to fill that role, um, can be important.

[36:05 - 36:06] Your board will only grow from there.

[36:07 - 36:09] So I heard a couple of you talk about, you know, how do I,

[36:10 - 36:11] how do I get rid of board members?

[36:12 - 36:13] Um, it's hard, right?

[36:13 - 36:17] So I do think caution as you grow your board is important.

[36:17 - 36:19] 'cause it's kind of a one way ratchet in a way.

[36:19 - 36:21] Um, you know,

[36:21 - 36:24] there comes a time often when those two founder seats are

[36:24 - 36:27] too many and the boardroom's getting crowded,

[36:27 - 36:29] and maybe that second founder is,

[36:29 - 36:31] you know, is likely is not.

[36:31 - 36:34] The CEO is a, an exec that reports to the CEO

[36:34 - 36:38] and it may be less appropriate at some stage for that person

[36:38 - 36:40] to be in all of the board discussions.

[36:40 - 36:43] Um, and, you know, there comes a time when

[36:44 - 36:47] that discussion needs to happen of we're gonna go to a,

[36:47 - 36:51] a board with one, you know, common seat, one founder seed.

[36:51 - 36:54] And you know, that's where two partners

[36:54 - 36:57] that have gone into business together, um, and

[36:57 - 36:59] or, you know, that independent director

[36:59 - 37:01] that I talked about in the previous chapter

[37:01 - 37:03] that you've recruited can have that conversation

[37:03 - 37:06] with the person about stepping back

[37:06 - 37:10] and being able to focus on, um, the management.

[37:10 - 37:13] And oftentimes it's a CTO or something.

[37:13 - 37:17] So product delivery, um, uh, kind of, um, skill sets

[37:17 - 37:19] and time devotion that they need.

[37:20 - 37:24] Um, and then you start to, to attach observers

[37:24 - 37:28] and additional investors and your board grows.

[37:28 - 37:32] And, um, I, I see companies make the mistake

[37:32 - 37:37] of being too generous with either observation rights

[37:37 - 37:39] that are contractual or worse with just inviting people

[37:39 - 37:41] to the board meeting that don't have observation

[37:41 - 37:42] rights as if it's theater.

[37:43 - 37:45] Um, I think you're doing it wrong if you're treating your

[37:45 - 37:48] board meeting as theater, uh, whether for the rest

[37:48 - 37:49] of your management team

[37:49 - 37:53] or for, you know, um, others that come along

[37:53 - 37:56] with your investors, um, you know, for the board

[37:56 - 37:59] to have an effective discussion for them to disagree

[37:59 - 38:03] with one another, um, to disagree with management

[38:03 - 38:06] and provide feedback, um, you not, not conflict,

[38:06 - 38:07] I'm not saying that in a negative way,

[38:07 - 38:09] but to have a healthy exchange

[38:09 - 38:11] and a dialogue that hopefully leads to a better answer.

[38:12 - 38:14] I think a more intimate environment is important.

[38:14 - 38:17] And so I would be very cautious about

[38:17 - 38:19] expanding the boardroom too much.

[38:19 - 38:21] It happens, you know, people don't wanna have

[38:21 - 38:25] that conversation and there can be a cultural impact

[38:25 - 38:28] of who's getting disinvited from the board meetings.

[38:28 - 38:30] That's real. Um,

[38:30 - 38:32] but I, you know, I do think, I, I forget

[38:32 - 38:33] who, who commented early.

[38:33 - 38:35] Maybe you just need to go have the

[38:35 - 38:36] direct conversation, Renee.

[38:37 - 38:41] Yeah, I think you do. Um, I think the best way to, to do

[38:41 - 38:46] that though is to start to have a dialogue about what the,

[38:46 - 38:47] the goals of the institution

[38:47 - 38:49] and the board meeting are first, um,

[38:50 - 38:52] make sure people have a common understanding of that.

[38:53 - 38:56] And that provides context for, you know,

[38:56 - 38:59] that next discussion about, you know, we,

[38:59 - 39:02] we we're gonna reduce this so that it's, um,

[39:02 - 39:05] it's not a fishbowl, it's a dialogue.

[39:05 - 39:07] And and it's not just you by the way.

[39:07 - 39:09] It's, you know, for other people

[39:09 - 39:12] that are gonna not be invited to the next meeting,

[39:13 - 39:15] maybe it's a little easier these days than Zoom.

[39:15 - 39:16] Maybe that's one of the advantages.

[39:16 - 39:18] You can just not provide the Zoom code to certain people.

[39:18 - 39:21] I don't know. Um, it's a little harder if they just can

[39:21 - 39:23] stumble into the boardroom, I guess.

[39:24 - 39:25] Um, but if they don't know when it is

[39:25 - 39:28] or what the meeting code is that maybe you don't have

[39:28 - 39:29] to have that direct conversation.

[39:30 - 39:33] I still think it's a good idea. Um, and then

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[39:33 - 39:36] One, one funny tidbit around that one, just for

[39:36 - 39:39] Zoom Entertainment was that we had a a,

[39:39 - 39:40] a science update meeting

[39:40 - 39:42] before our board meeting last summer.

[39:43 - 39:44] We had a bunch of observers.

[39:44 - 39:47] It was pre IPO, and the big request we got was,

[39:47 - 39:48] can you record it and send it to us?

[39:49 - 39:51] Yeah, sure. We're gonna give an update on all

[39:51 - 39:53] of our key science and progress.

[39:53 - 39:55] We'll just record that and send it to you. Yeah.

[39:55 - 39:57] And it's just a great example of,

[39:57 - 40:00] of people not really thinking through why

[40:00 - 40:01] that would be a bad idea.

[40:01 - 40:03] And my chairman was like, oh, wait, we can do that.

[40:03 - 40:05] And I was like, no, this isn't a, it's not a show,

[40:05 - 40:07] to your point, this is not a movie, right?

[40:07 - 40:10] We need to be really smart about the information flow.

[40:10 - 40:12] And I think that's part of the process, right?

[40:12 - 40:14] You start in these early stage companies

[40:14 - 40:16] and everyone's kind of clubby decisions get made

[40:16 - 40:17] kind of by consensus.

[40:17 - 40:19] Paperwork is kind of secondary.

[40:19 - 40:21] Record keeping is kind of sloppy.

[40:22 - 40:24] And then all of a sudden you are on this line

[40:24 - 40:27] of sight down the road eventually to either an acquisition

[40:27 - 40:31] or an IPO, and you've gotta start to professionalize.

[40:31 - 40:33] And, and I think that's part of what a lot

[40:33 - 40:34] of the folks in this group work on.

[40:34 - 40:36] How do you get in front of the board

[40:37 - 40:41] and put yourself in a position to just be a facilitator of

[40:42 - 40:44] not just good decision making, but good process.

[40:45 - 40:46] And I think that's what a lot

[40:46 - 40:47] of us are thinking about in our jobs.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[40:49 - 40:51] Sarah, I see your comment to Chad. That was a joke.

[40:51 - 40:53] I'm sorry. Yes, I agree.

[40:53 - 40:55] Not just pro, just not providing the Zoom

**[Speaker 19.0]**


[40:55 - 40:56] Links not the right answer. Sorry.

[40:56 - 40:57] I'm sorry about that.

[40:57 - 40:59] I did have to step away to help with dinner

[40:59 - 41:00] and I like wasn't watching you.

[41:00 - 41:03] So I may have not on the context, but yes, I agree.

[41:03 - 41:05] Getting them off is very difficult. Yeah.

[41:05 - 41:06] Or getting them off calls.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[41:09 - 41:10] Yeah, I think that's right, Julie.

[41:11 - 41:14] I think, um, you know, the who,

[41:14 - 41:15] who's on your board matters here.

[41:16 - 41:18] And for, for you as general counsels,

[41:18 - 41:23] if you can find an ally on the board to that end, I,

[41:23 - 41:25] I think that's immensely valuable to you.

[41:25 - 41:29] So if there's a, you know, a chairman, chair, chair person,

[41:30 - 41:31] um, that is senior and seasoned

[41:31 - 41:34] and cares about these things, that's great, right?

[41:34 - 41:36] You can go to them, you can talk to them about

[41:37 - 41:39] how do we work together to, to do this.

[41:39 - 41:42] If you're fighting, you know, a board that wants to cut

[41:42 - 41:45] to the chase and doesn't wanna work on these things

[41:45 - 41:47] and, you know, maybe A-A-C-E-O

[41:47 - 41:49] or a management team that isn't as focused on it,

[41:49 - 41:51] that can be a hard road to hoe.

[41:51 - 41:54] Um, and, and then I think you gotta spend a lot more time

[41:55 - 41:56] trying to demonstrate the value

[41:56 - 41:58] of it and the importance of it.

[41:58 - 42:01] And, you know, I, I find it hard.

[42:01 - 42:02] I know you all find it hard

[42:02 - 42:04] because I think a lot of the times you've got to,

[42:04 - 42:06] you've gotta go to sort of horror stories.

[42:06 - 42:09] And this is what happens when things go badly

[42:09 - 42:10] and don't let this be you.

[42:10 - 42:14] And, you know, I never like to have to persuade that way

[42:14 - 42:17] because I think it's easy for people to, you know,

[42:17 - 42:18] distance themselves from that

[42:18 - 42:19] and believe it's not gonna be them.

[42:20 - 42:22] But, you know, I've seen the movie,

[42:22 - 42:23] I've seen how it ends that way.

[42:24 - 42:27] It ends that way for many companies.

[42:27 - 42:31] Um, you know, and one way or another turning negative.

[42:31 - 42:33] And, and you want to have had the right governance along the

[42:33 - 42:34] way to, before you get to that point.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[42:39 - 42:40] So one of the other questions

[42:40 - 42:43] that we got at the outset was sort of around how

[42:43 - 42:44] to manage getting somebody off the board.

[42:44 - 42:45] And, and I know Alan and Kat,

[42:45 - 42:47] you've guys got some war stories around this.

[42:48 - 42:50] Um, before I, I direct you guys

[42:50 - 42:51] to sort of jump into the topic.

[42:52 - 42:54] One thing I'll, I'll share just for again,

[42:54 - 42:56] entertainment value, you know, we had a director at one

[42:56 - 43:00] of my prior employee employers who, um, was known to show up

[43:00 - 43:02] and then promptly fall asleep at the meeting,

[43:03 - 43:04] had been an employee of the company

[43:04 - 43:08] and a prior executive was on as our chairman, um,

[43:08 - 43:11] but often was the least useful person in the room.

[43:11 - 43:14] And sort of no way to move that person out with any,

[43:14 - 43:16] you know, ease, especially in the context

[43:16 - 43:18] of it being a public company where,

[43:18 - 43:19] you know, that would be very visible.

[43:19 - 43:21] And so I'm curious as to how you think about, right,

[43:21 - 43:23] if you're in the private company stage

[43:23 - 43:25] and you're going for a next round of financing,

[43:25 - 43:28] that's often an inflection point where you can sort

[43:28 - 43:29] of group together with some directors

[43:29 - 43:31] and talk about who should stay and who should go.

[43:32 - 43:34] But are there other strategies that you would recommend

[43:34 - 43:35] for thinking through and, and,

[43:35 - 43:37] and how do you see the GCs role in that?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[43:39 - 43:41] Yeah, I, you know, I've seen it, um,

[43:42 - 43:44] I've seen it go poorly and I've seen it go well.

[43:44 - 43:46] I think to your, uh, illusion, Julie,

[43:46 - 43:48] about the private company context.

[43:49 - 43:52] One of the harder situations is when it's a VC from a prior

[43:52 - 43:55] round that has a contractual right to that board seat.

[43:55 - 43:58] And you've, you've not only gotta ask the the person

[43:58 - 44:00] to step down, um,

[44:00 - 44:03] but you've gotta ask the VC to, to give up their right.

[44:04 - 44:07] There is a middle ground there that I see sort of work,

[44:07 - 44:10] which is to allow them to keep their contractual right

[44:10 - 44:13] and appoint, you know, an independent

[44:13 - 44:14] to their seat that you agree on.

[44:15 - 44:16] I don't love that solution.

[44:16 - 44:19] 'cause I think it, it compromises that incoming director's

[44:20 - 44:24] ability to truly feel independent if they are, you know,

[44:24 - 44:28] at the, at the behest of contractually, at the behest of a,

[44:28 - 44:30] of a particular investor.

[44:31 - 44:33] Um, even if that investor is saying,

[44:33 - 44:34] I'm not gonna exercise that, right?

[44:34 - 44:36] But that can be a bridge too, right?

[44:36 - 44:39] That can be a way to allow the VC to save face

[44:39 - 44:41] with their peers and not having to

[44:42 - 44:45] give up their rights while getting the person

[44:45 - 44:46] that you want in the door.

[44:46 - 44:49] And, you know, maybe nine months down the road that changes.

[44:50 - 44:53] Um, I do think that there's a, you know, a hard conversation

[44:53 - 44:54] that has to be had there.

[44:54 - 44:57] And usually it's the CEO that's, that's having it.

[44:57 - 45:00] Um, it's another situation where I think having

[45:00 - 45:05] an ally on the board, you know, um, can, can be valuable

[45:05 - 45:08] because it, it's personal and,

[45:08 - 45:11] and at one level you're telling, um, that director

[45:11 - 45:13] that you want off for whatever reason,

[45:13 - 45:15] that you don't find their contributions

[45:15 - 45:16] as valuable as the others.

[45:16 - 45:19] And that may be who their fund is

[45:19 - 45:20] and what connections they have.

[45:20 - 45:22] That may be their actual level

[45:22 - 45:23] of participation and engagement.

[45:24 - 45:27] Um, you know, I guess it's easier if they are

[45:28 - 45:31] openly disengaged or not attending or those sorts of things,

[45:31 - 45:33] but it's often more subtle than that.

[45:34 - 45:37] And so, you know, the, the worst situations I've seen

[45:37 - 45:40] that discussion led to a, you know, a conflict

[45:40 - 45:42] between the CEO and the director asked to leave

[45:42 - 45:45] that spilled out into, you know, the boardroom

[45:45 - 45:47] and was a public conflict and,

[45:47 - 45:51] and people were left feeling, uh, feeling badly about it.

[45:51 - 45:52] At the end of the day. I,

[45:53 - 45:57] I think the best situations I've seen, actually,

[45:57 - 45:58] it's a public company context,

[45:58 - 46:02] but I'm not sure it doesn't translate, were situations where

[46:02 - 46:06] there was a chair who himself ultimately needed to

[46:07 - 46:09] step aside in favor of new blood

[46:09 - 46:14] and, uh, open the dialogue, you know, a quarter in advance

[46:14 - 46:16] with the board about what the objectives are

[46:16 - 46:20] and how, you know, we've got a board that is here

[46:20 - 46:22] and we want to get it to here for these reasons.

[46:22 - 46:25] Whether it's diversity, bringing in more independence, um,

[46:26 - 46:28] bringing in more audit committee expertise,

[46:29 - 46:32] bringing in more operational skill sets to mentor the CEO.

[46:32 - 46:36] Um, we need to achieve all those objectives.

[46:36 - 46:38] And, you know, that's gonna involve some

[46:38 - 46:40] transitioning of board members.

[46:40 - 46:43] I, I'd like to hear from each of you what your, you know,

[46:43 - 46:46] continued interest level is in participating,

[46:46 - 46:48] but I'm gonna be talking to you about that dialogue

[46:48 - 46:50] and how we, how we order it.

[46:50 - 46:52] And I, I think trying to get people focused on

[46:54 - 46:56] why you're doing this in a way that is not personal to them

[46:56 - 46:58] and what, why it's good for the company

[46:59 - 47:02] is good table setting and just framing it

[47:02 - 47:05] and then building a plan where the succession that needs

[47:05 - 47:07] to happen is staged over time.

[47:07 - 47:11] So, you know, maybe one seed is surrendered every year,

[47:11 - 47:12] and that's known in advance.

[47:12 - 47:16] You know, we're gonna move out our series A director next

[47:16 - 47:19] year, and we're gonna replace them with, um,

[47:20 - 47:22] an independent diverse board member.

[47:22 - 47:25] And then in the second year, as we're a year away from IPO,

[47:25 - 47:27] we're gonna move out our series B board member

[47:27 - 47:29] and we're gonna replace 'em with an audit committee chair.

[47:29 - 47:33] Um, I think also having a plan, um,

[47:34 - 47:38] you know, can, can let the other directors participate in

[47:38 - 47:40] the plan, and it doesn't feel like that first person

[47:40 - 47:42] that got tapped is the one that's getting picked on.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[47:44 - 47:47] Yeah, I would, I would just reiterate that the, um,

[47:47 - 47:50] for a lot of you, you are later stage private companies

[47:51 - 47:54] and, uh, the preparation for going public needs

[47:54 - 47:56] to happen far earlier than an org meeting.

[47:57 - 48:01] Um, getting, getting a public company ready board needs

[48:01 - 48:03] to happen, you know, at least sometimes like 18 months,

[48:03 - 48:05] two years before you're gonna go out.

[48:06 - 48:07] Um, in particular, just

[48:07 - 48:11] because these days it's not just finding an audit committee

[48:11 - 48:12] financial expert and finding folks

[48:12 - 48:14] who can read financial statements.

[48:14 - 48:16] Um, if any of you have companies

[48:16 - 48:19] that are headquartered in California, you have to comply

[48:20 - 48:23] with the, you know, the California laws, uh, with respect

[48:23 - 48:26] to having, you know, women being on your board

[48:26 - 48:28] and underrepresented minorities on your board.

[48:29 - 48:32] Um, and for anyone who is planning to list on nasdaq,

[48:32 - 48:34] NASDAQ just came out with their rules, right?

[48:34 - 48:37] So your board, uh, within a year of listing would have

[48:37 - 48:39] to have a, a woman and an underrepresented

[48:39 - 48:40] minority, uh, on the board.

[48:41 - 48:45] And so also with the increased focus from like ISS,

[48:45 - 48:49] glass Lewis and every single major fund from Fidelity

[48:49 - 48:52] to State Street, to, you know, BlackRock,

[48:52 - 48:54] they all have governance guidelines now

[48:54 - 48:57] and, uh, diversity, uh, and, and,

[48:57 - 48:58] and focus on, you know,

[48:58 - 49:01] having effective boards is really, really important.

[49:01 - 49:04] So I think to Alan's point, like coming up

[49:04 - 49:07] with a strategy far earlier than actually being public about

[49:07 - 49:10] what is my board, you know, here to do

[49:10 - 49:13] and actually putting together like a rubric for

[49:13 - 49:15] what I want out of it, and, you know, coming up

[49:15 - 49:17] with actual competency matrices

[49:17 - 49:20] and who's checking kind of, uh, you know, what boxes,

[49:20 - 49:23] and it's not just from a, you know, this is a,

[49:23 - 49:24] a diverse candidate, but you know, someone

[49:24 - 49:26] who has operational background, someone

[49:26 - 49:29] who has experience scaling my particular type of business,

[49:29 - 49:33] um, you know, someone who has experience on doing, you know,

[49:33 - 49:35] extensive m and a, if that's a big part of your,

[49:35 - 49:38] your strategy, um, making sure that you're kind

[49:38 - 49:40] of filling those gaps and to Alan's point, planning

[49:41 - 49:42] how you're gonna fill those

[49:42 - 49:45] and starting a conversation early with, uh, you know,

[49:45 - 49:47] with your existing board members about

[49:47 - 49:50] how we're gonna reach those goals and transition to it.

[49:50 - 49:53] So it's a smooth glide into becoming a public company

[49:54 - 49:56] as opposed to this being like a slap dash rush, right?

[49:56 - 50:00] Like at an org meeting where you're frantically competing

[50:00 - 50:03] for candidates because, um, as I'm sure many

[50:03 - 50:06] of you are aware right now that the market for finding, um,

[50:06 - 50:09] independent board members, let alone people who can, uh,

[50:09 - 50:11] you know, folks who are women, folks

[50:11 - 50:13] who are underrepresented minorities, it is, it's very,

[50:13 - 50:14] very competitive right now.

[50:15 - 50:18] Um, and if you have to also be filling audit, you know,

[50:18 - 50:21] just audit competency, it's just, it's,

[50:21 - 50:22] it's a very competitive market.

[50:23 - 50:26] So starting the dialogue a lot earlier than you'd think

[50:27 - 50:32] can be actually a mechanism for you to help maneuver, uh,

[50:32 - 50:34] maneuver your board in the direction

[50:34 - 50:37] of going more independent, um, uh,

[50:37 - 50:39] you know, for the, for the long term.

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[50:39 - 50:41] Can I, can I push on that one for a second?

[50:41 - 50:44] I think that probably depends on what, um,

[50:45 - 50:47] what your vertical is, what your market is.

[50:47 - 50:50] I think you, you raised some really good points.

[50:50 - 50:51] I mean, we're going public very shortly.

[50:52 - 50:55] We have a board that is, uh, five

[50:55 - 50:57] of the nine are not white men, I put it that way.

[50:57 - 50:59] Mm-hmm. That way. Um,

[50:59 - 51:01] and it hits all our diversity requirements

[51:01 - 51:04] and then maybe harder for some, I think in other industries,

[51:04 - 51:06] if you're not an e-commerce in

[51:06 - 51:07] e-commerce, I think that's easier.

[51:09 - 51:10] The reality is like, I went

[51:10 - 51:13] through this a TripAdvisor a long time ago too

[51:13 - 51:14] before vivid seats

[51:14 - 51:18] and like, you're just trying to get through day-to-day

[51:18 - 51:19] and build your business, right?

[51:19 - 51:21] Like the reality is two years ahead of time.

[51:21 - 51:23] Like that's in your mind, right?

[51:23 - 51:25] That's your things you're talking about

[51:25 - 51:26] if you're there at the time.

[51:26 - 51:27] But a lot of us are stepping into the role

[51:28 - 51:30] maybe less than two years before you're going public.

[51:31 - 51:35] So there is some, you know, there's a lot of that,

[51:35 - 51:36] panic is not the right word.

[51:36 - 51:38] There's a lot of stuff you have to do very quickly.

[51:38 - 51:40] I think this is sort of one of them,

[51:40 - 51:42] and obviously you wanna be thinking about advance,

[51:42 - 51:43] but I would push on the fact that

[51:43 - 51:44] you need two years for that.

[51:44 - 51:46] I don't think that's necessarily,

[51:46 - 51:47] I think it's great if you can,

[51:47 - 51:48] but I think the reality of

[51:48 - 51:50] where we live in is you probably aren't

[51:50 - 51:51] gonna get that for some of us.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[51:52 - 51:54] Yeah. And Dan, I think some of us are gonna inherit

[51:54 - 51:55] that situation and hope our

[51:55 - 51:57] outside council's been helping them manage through some of

[51:57 - 51:58] that on the, on the front end,

[51:58 - 51:59] because you're right, we,

[51:59 - 52:02] we often don't get there until later.

[52:03 - 52:05] I do think that having gone through two,

[52:05 - 52:07] my last two companies went public with me joining sort

[52:07 - 52:10] of midstream in one and just prior for the other.

[52:10 - 52:14] And I can certainly tell you that the board's sense of,

[52:14 - 52:16] you know, the urgency around this was not as high

[52:16 - 52:17] as it probably ought to have been,

[52:17 - 52:19] at least in one of those two companies.

[52:20 - 52:21] And you're then playing catch up, right?

[52:21 - 52:22] You're, you're sort of being like, well,

[52:22 - 52:24] we'll get questionnaires and we'll see who qualifies.

[52:24 - 52:26] Like that's not a great place to be.

[52:26 - 52:28] So it, it's definitely a challenge.

[52:29 - 52:32] I do think that Kat's point though about the competition is

[52:32 - 52:33] exceedingly important, right?

[52:33 - 52:36] You know, I don't know how many folks in this group have

[52:36 - 52:38] some form of a board search, either active

[52:38 - 52:41] or thinking about it or sort of socializing it,

[52:41 - 52:43] but finding the right fit people

[52:44 - 52:45] for these roles is really hard.

[52:45 - 52:48] And if you also are trying to check the boxes on some

[52:48 - 52:50] of these important diversity rules,

[52:50 - 52:53] which are becoming effective for most of us in the next year

[52:53 - 52:55] or two, it's gonna be really challenging.

[52:55 - 52:57] And, and I think it's great that we're pushing companies

[52:57 - 52:58] to move in this direction,

[52:59 - 53:00] but we're all competing for the same talent.

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[53:01 - 53:05] Yeah. I, I would just jump, uh, I was gonna just

[53:07 - 53:09] So along, along the same lines of

[53:09 - 53:11] what other people are saying, I think, I think it's great

[53:11 - 53:12] to do it as far advance as you can.

[53:13 - 53:14] My company, we're probably there,

[53:14 - 53:15] we're starting to think about this.

[53:16 - 53:21] What I found, what I'm finding is that, you know,

[53:21 - 53:24] Alan, you said maybe getting a someone who has a,

[53:24 - 53:26] a contractual right off the board.

[53:26 - 53:28] I've found that to be not just at this company,

[53:28 - 53:30] but other companies, very hard for them to say, okay,

[53:31 - 53:32] I'm gonna give up my contractual, right.

[53:33 - 53:35] You don't really know when a company's gonna go public.

[53:35 - 53:36] Even if they think they're gonna go public,

[53:36 - 53:37] you don't know when COVID is gonna hit

[53:37 - 53:38] or something else is gonna hit.

[53:39 - 53:43] And, um, I found them, you know, not,

[53:44 - 53:46] not very open to that until they know

[53:46 - 53:48] that you're going public.

[53:48 - 53:51] Uh, and similarly you're talking about all the talent.

[53:51 - 53:55] I mean the, the, the competition for, uh, the talent,

[53:55 - 53:58] the IPO talent, the, the directors, they have a lot

[53:58 - 54:00] of other opportunities out there,

[54:00 - 54:04] and I'm not, I don't know that they're interested two years

[54:04 - 54:06] before maybe some companies,

[54:06 - 54:08] maybe there's a few companies they'd be interested in going

[54:08 - 54:10] to two years ahead of time in anticipation

[54:10 - 54:12] of it being, you know, being public.

[54:12 - 54:15] But there's only so many boards that they can really be on.

[54:15 - 54:17] So I think they're pretty particular

[54:18 - 54:21] and they, they wanna know a lot of them anyway, wanna know

[54:21 - 54:23] that this is more of a sure thing before they're,

[54:24 - 54:26] before they're, uh, committing to me.

[54:26 - 54:29] What seems to be the best thing to try to do is

[54:29 - 54:31] to start building those relationships, have,

[54:31 - 54:33] have the conversations, like you said,

[54:33 - 54:34] have conversations with the directors.

[54:34 - 54:35] This is what we want our board to look like,

[54:36 - 54:38] have conversations, start having conversations

[54:38 - 54:39] with potential board members

[54:39 - 54:42] and saying, look, if we're getting closer, you know,

[54:42 - 54:43] we'd really be interested in you.

[54:44 - 54:46] And then I don't know if you have to wait till,

[54:46 - 54:49] till you have your IPO kickoff meeting,

[54:49 - 54:53] but sometimes sooner than that, sometime closer to that,

[54:53 - 54:56] you know, nine months out when you're potentially even

[54:56 - 54:58] hiring your public company, CFO when

[54:58 - 54:59] you're, you know, those types of things.

[54:59 - 55:01] Now it's really getting into going,

[55:01 - 55:02] I think is is an easier time

[55:02 - 55:05] to make those transitions. That's my thoughts.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[55:05 - 55:07] Yeah, I think that's all true, Diane.

[55:07 - 55:09] I think a lot, a lot in a lot of cases it depends, right?

[55:09 - 55:11] There's sort of two themes going on

[55:11 - 55:12] in the world as I see it.

[55:12 - 55:14] There's one that's been there a little longer,

[55:14 - 55:16] which is companies we're taking longer

[55:16 - 55:18] and longer to go public and they were raising more

[55:18 - 55:19] and more money as private companies.

[55:19 - 55:23] And so you have these, you know, uh, unicorns, right?

[55:23 - 55:27] That, um, are raising larger and larger rounds on bigger

[55:27 - 55:30] and bigger valuations and adding more VCs to the mix.

[55:30 - 55:34] They can't just keep accumulating, you know, board members

[55:34 - 55:36] until they're 14 or 15, right?

[55:36 - 55:39] In that context, when you're asking your early stage

[55:39 - 55:42] investors that, you know, their strategy is not to keep up

[55:42 - 55:45] with growth stage investors, they don't have the,

[55:45 - 55:48] the balance sheets to, to do their pro rata share

[55:48 - 55:51] of those deals, you start to have it made more sense

[55:51 - 55:54] and be easier to, you know, replace an early one

[55:54 - 55:55] with a later one maybe.

[55:55 - 55:58] So that's, that may be a, a, a situation

[55:58 - 56:00] where you would find the contractual

[56:00 - 56:01] give up a little easier.

[56:02 - 56:05] The the other wave though is the SPAC wave, you know,

[56:05 - 56:06] and we have companies going public

[56:07 - 56:09] much earlier than they used to before.

[56:09 - 56:12] They've spent a long time planning, preparing,

[56:12 - 56:16] developing all the infrastructure, you know, working on,

[56:17 - 56:19] you know, um, SOX compliance.

[56:20 - 56:23] And I, I think it's gonna be interesting to see, um,

[56:24 - 56:25] you know, how that all turns out.

[56:25 - 56:27] Uh, it is gonna be a bit of an experiment

[56:27 - 56:30] and there are companies that have a very high level

[56:30 - 56:32] of sophistication and development

[56:32 - 56:33] at the time that they do it.

[56:33 - 56:35] And I, I trust that's all of you

[56:35 - 56:36] that are doing your SPACs right now.

[56:36 - 56:39] There are some that I've seen that it's, it's less so,

[56:39 - 56:41] and it's gonna be a bigger leap

[56:41 - 56:42] of faith for them to get there.

[56:43 - 56:46] And, and they, they wind up with a very short period

[56:46 - 56:49] of time in order to build all the infrastructure

[56:49 - 56:50] that you need to be a public company.

[56:51 - 56:53] I, I think where you don't want to be is

[56:53 - 56:54] to find yourself public

[56:55 - 56:57] and only focused on building your business.

[56:57 - 56:59] When you're in a fishbowl.

[56:59 - 57:01] The, the regulators, the investors,

[57:01 - 57:05] institutional investors are looking at you,

[57:05 - 57:06] uh, as a public company.

[57:06 - 57:09] They, they aren't gonna discern the fact that, um,

[57:10 - 57:12] you didn't have as much time to get ready as others

[57:12 - 57:13] and or aren't gonna care.

[57:14 - 57:16] Um, so you gotta catch up if you

[57:16 - 57:17] know if that's where you're gonna be.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[57:20 - 57:24] Hey, Alan and Kat, I have one question. Kat.

[57:24 - 57:27] You mentioned, you know, these, uh, board qualification

[57:27 - 57:31] and competency reviews, you know, qualification tables

[57:31 - 57:33] that public companies put out in proxies.

[57:34 - 57:37] Um, here's sort of looking

[57:37 - 57:40] for some practical guidance from anybody in this group.

[57:41 - 57:43] You send out, you know, a competency matrix,

[57:44 - 57:45] qualification matrix to the board,

[57:45 - 57:50] and people will sort of cross out as their competencies,

[57:50 - 57:53] all sorts of boxes, right? Um,

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[57:53 - 57:56] They'll say they're excellent at everything except at

[57:56 - 57:57] anything that gets 'em stuck on the audit committee.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[57:58 - 58:00] Oh, there you, there you go. Right?

[58:00 - 58:03] Look, someone who's doing middle market deals is not gonna

[58:03 - 58:06] be the right person for somebody who's

[58:07 - 58:09] a public company looking for transformational deals, right?

[58:10 - 58:14] Someone who has done a lot of,

[58:14 - 58:17] and you all should not take anything about our board

[58:17 - 58:19] as a result of this, this, these comments,

[58:19 - 58:20] but just think about it, right?

[58:21 - 58:24] Someone who's dealt with construction industry, all of his

[58:24 - 58:26] or her life is not going to be the person who's going

[58:26 - 58:29] to be able to say, yeah, pay

[58:31 - 58:33] 10 times the revenue of this tech company

[58:33 - 58:36] because here's why it makes sense or doesn't, right?

[58:38 - 58:42] Any thoughts, practical pointers on how you interact with

[58:42 - 58:45] those kinds of situations?

[58:45 - 58:48] In my mind, right? Where I'm trying to lead this is

[58:49 - 58:52] create a pathway of the two, three years down the road

[58:52 - 58:55] where people who are not suited for those seats

[58:56 - 58:58] eventually reach the conclusion that, Hey,

[58:58 - 58:59] I've had a great run.

[59:00 - 59:04] Let me put this in better hands here, if you may.

[59:05 - 59:07] And, you know, and, and we'll, we'll invite you for dinners

[59:07 - 59:08] and drinks and whatnot,

[59:08 - 59:12] but boardroom is intended for that foresight

[59:12 - 59:13] and insight rule here, right?

[59:14 - 59:16] Any thoughts anybody can share on this group

[59:16 - 59:18] that might be practical pointers would be helpful.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[59:23 - 59:25] I can jump in, but we can see if the,

[59:25 - 59:27] the group has crowdsourced ideas.

[59:34 - 59:38] Yeah. So, you know, I, I think one, let's be honest, most

[59:38 - 59:40] of the time it is A-A-C-E-O

[59:40 - 59:43] or a founder that is building, you know, their board,

[59:43 - 59:44] particularly at these stages.

[59:45 - 59:47] And the relationship that he

[59:47 - 59:51] or she has with, um, those members

[59:51 - 59:53] that have been recruited is important to this.

[59:53 - 59:56] And so I, I'm not sure you rely on self-reporting

[59:56 - 59:59] for each director to, to say what their skills are

[59:59 - 60:01] and if they scale to the next level.

[60:01 - 60:05] I think, um, you know, I think the, the people tasked

[60:05 - 60:06] with recruiting the board

[60:06 - 60:09] or the ones that have to make their own assessment of that

[60:09 - 60:12] and about what the company needs, oftentimes that's a CEO.

[60:13 - 60:15] But one thing that's occurred to me in this conversation

[60:15 - 60:20] that um, uh, I I think is an interesting thought is,

[60:20 - 60:23] is there value in, in,

[60:23 - 60:26] in paneling a nominating corporate governance committee

[60:26 - 60:27] at an earlier stage?

[60:27 - 60:28] It's not something that's required

[60:28 - 60:30] until you're a public company.

[60:30 - 60:32] I tend to not be a fan of,

[60:32 - 60:35] I certainly don't want people building bureaucracy

[60:35 - 60:37] or building committees

[60:37 - 60:39] and structure that you're not going to use.

[60:40 - 60:43] Um, however, on that, the other side of

[60:43 - 60:46] that coin is when you impanel something like a committee

[60:46 - 60:49] and give it a charter, it tends to do things.

[60:49 - 60:52] And, you know, that may be a way,

[60:52 - 60:56] if you have the right people to, um, to join it

[60:56 - 61:00] and lead it to, to create some leadership and,

[61:00 - 61:02] and activism around thinking about this issue

[61:02 - 61:04] and being proactive in terms of how

[61:04 - 61:08] to shape the board in conjunction with the CEO's needs.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[61:09 - 61:12] You know, it's interesting. We did a, an exercise at one

[61:12 - 61:14] of my companies where we did that competency chart

[61:14 - 61:16] and we asked directors to fill it out

[61:16 - 61:18] and we debated having the nominating corporate governance

[61:18 - 61:20] committee fill it out for the whole board,

[61:21 - 61:22] and ultimately we're pushed

[61:22 - 61:24] to have each director self-report,

[61:25 - 61:27] which was really an interesting lesson in who's an easy

[61:27 - 61:28] grader and who's a hard grader.

[61:29 - 61:33] Um, ultimately though, we used that as an exercise to try

[61:33 - 61:36] to identify a phenotype for a candidate search

[61:36 - 61:37] that we wanted to kick off that management was pushing

[61:38 - 61:40] for an additional director and wanted to get

[61:40 - 61:42] to an alignment on a profile.

[61:42 - 61:45] You know, it can be a helpful way to try to do it.

[61:45 - 61:48] And you can design that chart, right?

[61:48 - 61:49] You don't have to take a generic

[61:49 - 61:50] chart that you find from somebody.

[61:50 - 61:52] You can design the chart to match

[61:52 - 61:54] what you think is important in the skillset.

[61:55 - 61:57] And, you know, depending on the honesty

[61:57 - 61:59] and the self-awareness of your board,

[61:59 - 62:01] you can have a pretty good discussion around that.

[62:01 - 62:04] And to the point made earlier by Alan, like, you could have

[62:04 - 62:05] that at the, at a board meeting

[62:05 - 62:09] and you, you'd need a director to lead that typically

[62:09 - 62:11] with a little bit of humility, right?

[62:12 - 62:13] Somebody who can come in and say,

[62:13 - 62:15] I know I don't get a five in every one of these categories.

[62:15 - 62:18] There's certain areas as I bring strength in other areas

[62:18 - 62:20] where I defer to others, and that's a healthy dynamic.

[62:21 - 62:23] I think you can set it up and have that conversation,

[62:23 - 62:27] but identifying sort of where the gaps are

[62:27 - 62:30] can be a really important way as a first step

[62:30 - 62:32] to then saying, okay, how do we apply this to our board

[62:32 - 62:34] and say, do we have the right people?

[62:34 - 62:36] Where do we need to go over time?

[62:36 - 62:38] And you know, you, you often,

[62:38 - 62:40] if you sit in enough board meetings, right,

[62:40 - 62:43] you hear feedback about the CEO, you'll hear them talking.

[62:43 - 62:46] You'll say like, you know, you need mentorship in this area,

[62:47 - 62:48] and you're like looking around the board table

[62:48 - 62:50] and you're like, well, none of you have that skillset,

[62:50 - 62:52] so maybe that's a gap, right?

[62:52 - 62:54] So there are opportunities where you can do it,

[62:54 - 62:56] and I do think there's an important role that,

[62:56 - 62:58] that we play in this discussion, right?

[62:58 - 63:00] Even where the CEO might be the one

[63:00 - 63:04] to have the awkward conversation with the director, right?

[63:04 - 63:07] There's a conversation to be had with the CEO internally

[63:07 - 63:09] that says, here's where we are, right?

[63:09 - 63:12] Everything's a continuum. We're gonna try to get

[63:12 - 63:14] to this later stage in our life cycle.

[63:14 - 63:16] We need to look like this when we get there,

[63:17 - 63:18] how do we plan for it?

[63:18 - 63:21] How do we get ahead of it? And those have been some

[63:21 - 63:23] of the conversations I've had with my CEOs in, in the course

[63:23 - 63:26] of my career where I feel like I'm adding a lot of of value

[63:26 - 63:28] and where I can be a thought partner for him

[63:28 - 63:30] or for her to try and have those conversations

[63:30 - 63:31] and be proactive so

[63:31 - 63:33] that you're not sitting at the org meeting

[63:33 - 63:35] and going, oh, right, we need a financial expert.

[63:35 - 63:36] Who do we have?

**[Speaker 18.0]**


[63:37 - 63:40] So our company was recently acquired

[63:40 - 63:41] by a private equity firm

[63:41 - 63:44] and they required the entire executive team

[63:44 - 63:47] to undergo disc assessment, um, tests.

[63:47 - 63:49] And we all thought that was kind of silly.

[63:50 - 63:53] Um, but once we got the results we were

[63:53 - 63:56] after, we were all horrified at our own results.

[63:57 - 64:00] We were encouraged to share them with each other and,

[64:02 - 64:04] and also we're trying to hire a new CFO.

[64:04 - 64:08] Um, and they were required to take the DISC assessment

[64:08 - 64:12] and some people were eliminated immediately

[64:12 - 64:16] because they didn't indicate the traits that were desirable

[64:16 - 64:17] for the particular role, you know,

[64:18 - 64:23] but it also shows there, there's lots of stuff like how

[64:23 - 64:24] to communicate with people and so forth,

[64:24 - 64:27] but you can also identify, do these people have the traits

[64:27 - 64:32] that are associated with the role of a board member

[64:32 - 64:33] that you are desiring?

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[64:37 - 64:39] It's really interesting. I can do it.

[64:39 - 64:41] We just did a disc for our executive team last week.

[64:41 - 64:44] I did it for my legal team in July

[64:44 - 64:47] because I think it's a really great exercise to go through.

[64:47 - 64:49] I've done it, did it years ago at

[64:49 - 64:51] TripAdvisor a number of times.

[64:51 - 64:53] Um, we had the discussion about

[64:53 - 64:56] as we add board members in the future, would we do that?

[64:57 - 64:58] I think it's a useful tool.

[64:58 - 64:59] I would add, and, and this is kind

[64:59 - 65:01] of coming from our moderator, that like,

[65:02 - 65:03] don't use this as a hiring tool.

[65:03 - 65:05] Like, I think it's a dangerous thing.

[65:05 - 65:07] I mean, our, our executive team, I think like a lot of you,

[65:08 - 65:09] you'll find out if you've done it,

[65:10 - 65:12] is gonna over index towards the ds.

[65:12 - 65:13] I think that's sort of a natural,

[65:14 - 65:18] a natural thing in leadership, but just

[65:18 - 65:20] because you over index there doesn't mean you want,

[65:20 - 65:23] don't wanna hire an I for your CFO,

[65:23 - 65:25] for example, whatever it may be.

[65:25 - 65:27] I, I just think that's it.

[65:27 - 65:29] It's a tool, not something

[65:29 - 65:30] that should be used as a determinant.

[65:30 - 65:32] Um, but I, I don't think

[65:32 - 65:33] there's anything scary about it either.

[65:33 - 65:34] And I'm someone who's a convert.

[65:34 - 65:36] 'cause when I first heard these 10 years ago, my god,

[65:36 - 65:39] more HR process stuff, that's a waste of my time.

[65:40 - 65:42] And I acknowledged that I was wrong about it

[65:42 - 65:43] and I found it really helpful.

[65:44 - 65:47] But I also, it's a, I almost think it's a little dangerous

[65:47 - 65:49] to lean on it too much also.

[65:49 - 65:51] Sorry Julie, I didn't mean to interrupt.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[65:52 - 65:55] No, it's totally fine. So I wanna make sure we also have

[65:55 - 65:57] space for folks who have other topics

[65:57 - 65:58] they want us to go into.

[65:58 - 65:59] So if there're folks who have other

[66:00 - 66:02] directions they want this conversation to go,

[66:02 - 66:04] I wanna give a pause and let folks jump in with questions.

[66:11 - 66:13] All right. Well, while folks are thinking I'll,

[66:13 - 66:15] I'll take us in a slightly different direction.

[66:15 - 66:16] Um, Kat

[66:16 - 66:20] and Alan, how do you think about best interacting

[66:20 - 66:21] with your board, right?

[66:21 - 66:22] What are some of the best practices

[66:22 - 66:24] that you would recommend in terms of

[66:25 - 66:26] managing the board relationship

[66:26 - 66:29] and managing how the board gets information flow?

[66:29 - 66:32] Um, I'll, I'll throw a couple of thoughts that I have in,

[66:32 - 66:33] into the mix, but open

[66:33 - 66:35] to obviously others from around the room.

[66:36 - 66:37] You know, we, we think a lot about

[66:38 - 66:41] how do we deliver materials to the board that are secure,

[66:41 - 66:44] but also positioning well for discussion

[66:44 - 66:46] and for decision making at the meetings

[66:46 - 66:49] and having this balance between pre-reads

[66:49 - 66:51] and discussion at the meeting and,

[66:51 - 66:53] and not just reading slides to them.

[66:53 - 66:55] I don't think anyone at any company feels like

[66:55 - 66:56] they get it perfectly right.

[66:56 - 67:00] But I'm curious as to what you think are some best practices

[67:00 - 67:03] because for us, you know, I, I struggle with the fact

[67:03 - 67:04] that I'm not confident that a lot

[67:04 - 67:05] of folks do all the pre-reading,

[67:05 - 67:08] which is a really frustrating feeling, but a reality.

[67:09 - 67:11] And at the same time, you know,

[67:11 - 67:12] you don't wanna be reading slides

[67:12 - 67:13] and it's really disheartening

[67:13 - 67:16] to the leadership team if you feel like you put all this

[67:16 - 67:17] work into the materials

[67:17 - 67:19] and then you're sort of reading them

[67:19 - 67:20] to the, to the board members.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[67:22 - 67:24] Yeah, I I think you're right about,

[67:24 - 67:27] um, no one ever getting that right.

[67:27 - 67:29] I do a lot of board self-evaluations

[67:29 - 67:32] and I think it's commonly a topic from one end

[67:32 - 67:34] to the other for a complaint.

[67:34 - 67:38] Um, I do most commonly hear directors asking for

[67:39 - 67:42] more strategic discussion, more focused opportunity

[67:43 - 67:45] for dialogue and less reading of slides.

[67:45 - 67:48] And that's a common, um,

[67:48 - 67:52] common refrain I see in the chat folks saying, I, I'm not,

[67:52 - 67:54] I'm skeptical that people do the pre-read.

[67:55 - 67:57] I think you gotta count on 'em to do the pre-read.

[67:57 - 68:01] Um, and you gotta think about replacing 'em if they're not.

[68:01 - 68:02] But, um,

[68:05 - 68:07] the pre-read can be voluminous.

[68:07 - 68:10] I think, uh, having a common pattern so that people know

[68:10 - 68:12] where to look for updates on the information,

[68:13 - 68:15] but also really doing an executive summary

[68:16 - 68:19] or some way to highlight, you know, these are,

[68:19 - 68:22] these are the 10 things that jump out on the screen.

[68:22 - 68:26] They're not buried on page 80 that, you know, our,

[68:26 - 68:29] our CAC is going down or are we're having a churn problem

[68:29 - 68:30] or, you know, whatever it might be.

[68:31 - 68:33] Um, we're gonna call that to your attention so you see it.

[68:34 - 68:37] And by the way, these are the three questions that I want us

[68:37 - 68:39] to discuss and focus on at this board meeting.

[68:40 - 68:41] And so, you know, having that front

[68:41 - 68:44] and center, like the first page of the board package so

[68:44 - 68:47] that people can, um, can focus in on

[68:47 - 68:50] what the key data is they need to pick up and then go deeper

[68:51 - 68:53] and they can start thinking in advance about

[68:53 - 68:54] what the questions are.

[68:55 - 68:57] Um, and then just from the, the governance perspective,

[68:57 - 68:59] this is a little more boring than that topic,

[68:59 - 69:03] but, um, preor organizing,

[69:03 - 69:07] what is the approval agenda both from, you know, a list

[69:07 - 69:08] of items that need to be approved,

[69:08 - 69:10] but also actually drafting the resolutions in advance,

[69:11 - 69:12] you know, where there are blanks

[69:12 - 69:14] or decisions that need to be made, you know,

[69:14 - 69:16] leaving that decision tree.

[69:16 - 69:19] And clearly, I, I find these situations in board meetings

[69:19 - 69:21] where that isn't done from time to time.

[69:22 - 69:24] You come away as, as council trying to draft minutes

[69:24 - 69:25] and it's not totally clear

[69:25 - 69:27] that everybody did agree on the same thing.

[69:28 - 69:30] Um, getting it in front of them so

[69:30 - 69:32] that they're actually looking at a concrete, you know,

[69:33 - 69:35] resolution or program that they're passing and,

[69:35 - 69:38] and making sure that's written down I think can be valuable.

[69:38 - 69:40] And so I, I like to do a meeting with, um,

[69:41 - 69:43] inhouse council a week before a board meeting.

[69:43 - 69:46] We work together on going through the agenda items,

[69:46 - 69:48] getting the resolutions drafted, running

[69:48 - 69:49] to ground any open issues

[69:49 - 69:52] or problems, um, so that that's all prepackaged

[69:52 - 69:54] and ready to go and organized

[69:54 - 69:56] by the time the board package comes along.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[69:57 - 69:59] Yeah, I would, uh, so I think, uh,

[69:59 - 70:02] one point I think Meredith put in the chat was like the, uh,

[70:02 - 70:04] I think that's the Amazon style, right?

[70:04 - 70:08] Like Amazon starts every single meeting with like the first

[70:08 - 70:09] whatever, 10 or 15 minutes

[70:09 - 70:11] or for people to like literally sit quietly and read.

[70:12 - 70:15] Um, I, I kind of side a little bit with Alan in the sense

[70:15 - 70:18] of like, you know, you don't often have, you know,

[70:18 - 70:20] boards aren't meeting that frequently.

[70:20 - 70:23] Uh, it's usually four to six meetings a year.

[70:23 - 70:26] Um, and the expectation is that they would, um,

[70:26 - 70:28] that they would hopefully be doing a pre-read.

[70:28 - 70:30] But I think in order to ensure

[70:30 - 70:32] and set yourself up for success

[70:32 - 70:36] or to, um, you know, one is, uh,

[70:36 - 70:38] to I think Jolie's point,

[70:38 - 70:39] like putting together like an executive summary

[70:39 - 70:43] that's like pretty, you know, tight that's gonna hit on all

[70:43 - 70:44] of the major points is gonna be important.

[70:44 - 70:46] So if someone is short on time,

[70:46 - 70:49] they at least have a single source that is gonna have all

[70:49 - 70:52] of the material points that need to be conveyed to the board

[70:52 - 70:55] and potentially teed up for discussion in,

[70:55 - 70:56] in an executive summary.

[70:56 - 71:00] Um, followed up by, you know, like the more robust kind

[71:00 - 71:03] of PowerPoint that's gonna have all of the, you know,

[71:03 - 71:05] let's dive into the details.

[71:05 - 71:07] And then there's a completely separate much, much,

[71:07 - 71:10] much shorter deck that will just guide the discussion.

[71:10 - 71:12] Uh, and the, the talking points

[71:12 - 71:14] for the actual meeting itself,

[71:14 - 71:16] those shouldn't be the same deck.

[71:16 - 71:18] They need to be separate decks, which is the deep dive

[71:19 - 71:21] and then the actual presentation deck.

[71:21 - 71:23] Um, and then there's also just some nuts

[71:23 - 71:24] and bolts things too.

[71:24 - 71:26] Like I know a lot of folks are moving

[71:26 - 71:28] to actual board, um, platforms.

[71:29 - 71:32] So meaning making sure that your board members actually know

[71:32 - 71:35] how to access and use the platform, um,

[71:35 - 71:37] or if you're, you know, using Google Docs

[71:37 - 71:39] or whatever it is, just making sure

[71:39 - 71:42] that folks technologically can get a hold of the docs.

[71:42 - 71:44] That's, I think a kind of a bit of a complaint

[71:44 - 71:47] that I've seen from, from board members that they, you know,

[71:47 - 71:48] quote, I didn't know how to download it

[71:48 - 71:50] or I didn't know how to get the materials.

[71:50 - 71:52] It's a, it's a low bar thing,

[71:52 - 71:54] but um, just something that you should,

[71:54 - 71:55] you should be checking on.

[71:56 - 71:58] Um, and again, like also just making sure

[71:58 - 72:00] that you get the materials out with

[72:00 - 72:02] sufficient advanced notice.

[72:02 - 72:04] Um, you know, I definitely think for our,

[72:04 - 72:06] our smaller private companies, you know,

[72:07 - 72:10] board materials are often going out only like less than

[72:10 - 72:11] 24 hours in advance.

[72:11 - 72:13] Sometimes it's quite a bit of a scramble,

[72:13 - 72:16] but I think the expectation in particular as you,

[72:16 - 72:18] as you grow as a company is those materials need

[72:18 - 72:21] to be going out with, you know, needs to be more time.

[72:22 - 72:25] Um, so the board actually has time to, you know, review

[72:25 - 72:27] and digest it, not just 24 hours

[72:27 - 72:30] or 36 hours notice, um, for the materials.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[72:32 - 72:35] And by the way, this is all more important in Zoom land

[72:35 - 72:37] because, um, you know, you don't,

[72:37 - 72:39] you have people's attention for less time

[72:39 - 72:41] or you should, your meetings should probably be sorter

[72:41 - 72:43] and more focused while, you know,

[72:43 - 72:45] we're in these virtual worlds.

[72:45 - 72:47] Um, 'cause people get fatigued more, more quickly

[72:47 - 72:52] and it's harder to, um, have the, the, the triggers

[72:52 - 72:55] that come from, um, being able

[72:55 - 72:57] to lay eyes on people in person and

[72:57 - 73:00] and respond to conversation and, and human interaction.

[73:00 - 73:03] So I think focusing in the meeting on the key things

[73:03 - 73:05] that need to be taken away is,

[73:05 - 73:06] is ever more important in this world.

[73:07 - 73:09] But like there was a question there

[73:09 - 73:10] that I talked over, who is Meredith?

**[Speaker 14.0]**


[73:11 - 73:13] Um, I, I just had a question about board portals,

[73:13 - 73:17] you know, like board document portals and like why

[73:17 - 73:20] or if people think that's really a valuable thing or not.

[73:20 - 73:22] I mean I know that many companies use them

[73:22 - 73:24] and once you get a lot

[73:24 - 73:26] of communications it's probably useful

[73:26 - 73:27] just 'cause it's all in one place.

[73:27 - 73:29] But I'm just curious if anyone has a view about that.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[73:30 - 73:32] Yeah, so Meredith, I I have a couple thoughts.

[73:32 - 73:34] I mean they're, in terms of which one to use,

[73:34 - 73:35] I think they're a bit fungible,

[73:36 - 73:39] but I actually like them for two particular reasons.

[73:39 - 73:41] One is the security of the information.

[73:41 - 73:44] So the ability to keep your important information

[73:44 - 73:47] behind some sort of secure system, not just email appeals

[73:47 - 73:50] to me, but I also think it's really valuable

[73:50 - 73:52] for folks in our seat in particular, right?

[73:52 - 73:55] It gives me a role where I get to step in

[73:55 - 73:57] and say, you know, we'll manage the portal,

[73:57 - 73:58] we'll manage the distribution material

[73:59 - 74:01] and everything goes to the board through that portal.

[74:02 - 74:05] It gives me a lot of, um, centralization of

[74:05 - 74:07] how information flows out

[74:07 - 74:08] and puts me in the middle of it,

[74:08 - 74:10] which I think is good from a governance perspective

[74:10 - 74:12] and also an information flow perspective.

[74:13 - 74:14] 'cause I know what's gonna be going in front of the board.

[74:15 - 74:18] So I, I think selfishly I like it for both those reasons.

[74:18 - 74:19] I don't know if other folks have different views.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[74:20 - 74:23] You, one thing you may wanna consider is there's some

[74:24 - 74:25] literature out there in recent case law,

[74:25 - 74:30] certainly in Delaware on when some

[74:30 - 74:31] of these things become discoverable

[74:32 - 74:34] and, uh, how to manage the

[74:35 - 74:36] litigation holes and things like that.

[74:37 - 74:39] Just making sure that, you know, the, the, the line between,

[74:41 - 74:42] uh, uh,

[74:42 - 74:45] what information should remain privileged is actually

[74:45 - 74:46] remaining privileged and all.

[74:47 - 74:48] And I think doing that from uh,

[74:49 - 74:53] portals is much easier than using their own personal emails

[74:54 - 74:57] or God forbid you actually provide them a company email

[74:57 - 75:00] address and, and then, you know, have to deal with that.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[75:01 - 75:04] Yeah, I I, I think actually that's a, that's a important,

[75:04 - 75:06] like, it seems like a small point,

[75:06 - 75:09] but I, I think there was recent case law that came out of

[75:09 - 75:11] where when you're emailing your board

[75:11 - 75:13] and they're using like not, you know,

[75:13 - 75:16] company email addresses, it's gonna jeopardize privilege.

[75:16 - 75:20] And so I think that's why using potentially a a, a system,

[75:20 - 75:23] like I saw many people mention Diligent, that's what a lot

[75:23 - 75:24] of my clients have used as well.

[75:25 - 75:27] Um, you know, using a system

[75:27 - 75:30] or if you're not gonna use the system actually creating like

[75:30 - 75:34] an alias for your board, you know, like if it's board at,

[75:34 - 75:36] um, you know, your company name.com

[75:36 - 75:39] or something like that, uh, to,

[75:39 - 75:41] to keep your privilege tight, um,

[75:41 - 75:44] and to make sure you don't have any accidental leakage.

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[75:47 - 75:51] I ask a, We think as much that that's privileged

[75:52 - 75:53] from in a, in a board deck.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[75:55 - 75:56] Sorry, there Certain, there could be,

[75:56 - 75:59] we've certainly had things where we had derivative lawsuits

[75:59 - 76:00] or other things like that where we were getting

[76:00 - 76:01] advice or sharing advice.

[76:01 - 76:03] We would typically not put it in the slides.

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[76:03 - 76:05] That's what I was say. I don't put anything I have like

[76:05 - 76:07] legal update is what I put in this slide.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[76:08 - 76:09] No, we've done that Diane,

[76:09 - 76:11] but we've also had to do resolutions in some cases

[76:11 - 76:14] and at least those could theoretically have something in it.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[76:15 - 76:18] Y yeah, no, or if you're just emailing out the materials,

[76:18 - 76:21] people then just start replying on the thread, right?

[76:21 - 76:22] And they just start saying things

[76:22 - 76:26] and you can't control necessarily what people reply back

[76:26 - 76:27] to you, right?

[76:27 - 76:28] So I think that's part of the concern.

[76:29 - 76:31] It shouldn't, it's not just the materials themselves,

[76:31 - 76:33] but it's the dialogue that could follow them.

[76:34 - 76:36] Um, that, that we also wanna be really mindful of.

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[76:37 - 76:39] So I have a question. Do have a question?

[76:39 - 76:41] Yeah, I have a, well I have a question sort of like,

[76:42 - 76:44] piggybacking on all of this, which is like,

[76:46 - 76:49] and I think it's uh, Diane, it's sort of like what,

[76:49 - 76:50] touching on what you just said,

[76:51 - 76:55] but like when you do need to communicate those sensitive,

[76:55 - 76:58] like let's call 'em low lights, um, of the quarter

[76:58 - 77:02] or you know, whatever period to the board of directors, like

[77:02 - 77:05] how do people think about like, navigating that?

[77:05 - 77:08] Is it something that we should be documenting

[77:08 - 77:09] in a board deck board?

[77:09 - 77:11] Is it something that we should just be talking about

[77:11 - 77:12] with like the audit committee?

[77:13 - 77:15] Just what are, what's the, what are the thoughts on that?

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[77:20 - 77:22] What else wanna go? And Karen, if you,

[77:22 - 77:24] if you're talking about, you know, the data of, you know,

[77:24 - 77:27] the results for the quarter, those, those are facts, right?

[77:27 - 77:30] Those are what they are. If you're talking about, I

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[77:30 - 77:33] Mean I'm, I'm talking about like just issues like yeah,

[77:34 - 77:37] Oh we Had a, we had a quality issue like this past

[77:37 - 77:39] quarter and like here's the download of it.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[77:40 - 77:43] Yeah, I mean, I'm a big believer in thinking really

[77:43 - 77:44] strategically about what should be in writing

[77:44 - 77:46] and what should not be in writing to Diane's point.

[77:47 - 77:48] I, you know, I think there are a lot of times

[77:48 - 77:51] where you might put, you know, a, a topic for discussion

[77:51 - 77:52] but not put the detail

[77:53 - 77:56] or you might put, you know, just so you just lead that

[77:56 - 77:57] to an exec session and bring it up verbally

[77:57 - 77:58] if that makes the most sense.

[77:59 - 78:01] You know, it is important to think about record keeping

[78:02 - 78:03] and, and who's gonna have access.

[78:03 - 78:05] And especially if you have investors on your board

[78:05 - 78:07] who are used to pulling the deck down

[78:07 - 78:08] and sharing it with everybody at their firm,

[78:08 - 78:10] which is something to think about.

[78:10 - 78:11] You wanna be really mindful.

[78:12 - 78:13] 'cause you know, there, there may be loss

[78:13 - 78:15] of privilege along the way through that

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[78:15 - 78:16] Yeah. Loss

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[78:17 - 78:18] As well as with minutes, you know, I do,

[78:18 - 78:22] they should typically be topic level items, not details

[78:22 - 78:23] of who said what to whom.

[78:23 - 78:25] And you know, what the background is.

[78:26 - 78:29] 'cause um, you don't know where they're gonna come up again,

[78:29 - 78:31] whether with other employees internally

[78:31 - 78:35] or um, next investment round

[78:35 - 78:37] or an acquisition, oftentimes that's a due,

[78:37 - 78:38] that's a due diligence request these days.

[78:38 - 78:40] And you can push back, but you may not win that.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[78:42 - 78:44] One Of the other things on board portals is

[78:44 - 78:46] that you can use them for secure emails.

[78:46 - 78:49] So you can send materials and you can send an email,

[78:49 - 78:51] but have it go through a secure mechanism.

[78:51 - 78:53] So the content of the email doesn't even show

[78:53 - 78:54] up on their phone.

[78:54 - 78:56] They have to log in to see the email.

[78:56 - 78:58] Just something else to think about.

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[78:58 - 78:59] Julie, has that been a challenge?

[79:00 - 79:03] So I, I'm watching diligent literally this week, you know,

[79:03 - 79:06] with board members, uh, some of whom are already on diligent

[79:06 - 79:08] for other boards, some of whom are not.

[79:08 - 79:11] And so I'm trying to balance how much we're using

[79:12 - 79:15] diligent versus how much accepting the reality

[79:15 - 79:17] of my CEO is going to email his board as well.

[79:17 - 79:20] Like how much is in the portal, obviously the materials

[79:20 - 79:22] for the board meetings, audit committee, et cetera,

[79:23 - 79:27] versus what's happening via email in terms

[79:27 - 79:28] of like general discussions to the board

[79:29 - 79:30] outside of the portal.

[79:30 - 79:32] So I'm kind of curious how people have found that,

[79:32 - 79:33] because I imagine there's probably some

[79:34 - 79:36] variance in that experience.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[79:37 - 79:39] Yeah, and I certainly push hard that everything should go

[79:39 - 79:41] through the portal and I don't

[79:41 - 79:42] win a hundred percent of the time.

[79:42 - 79:45] But, you know, the things that we tend to get

[79:45 - 79:48] pushback on are things like press releases.

[79:48 - 79:50] If we're giving them a press release right

[79:50 - 79:52] before it issues, they're like, well, it's gonna be public.

[79:52 - 79:54] I'm like, yeah, but it's not public yet.

[79:54 - 79:56] And I, I tend to fall back to Meredith's point about

[79:56 - 80:00] let's have the directors have one stop shopping for all

[80:00 - 80:01] of our content in one place.

[80:02 - 80:04] I have a four month old daughter

[80:04 - 80:05] and she's on my lap, so I apologize.

[80:06 - 80:08] Uh, but in addition to that, I would say that, you know,

[80:08 - 80:10] I think it can be challenging.

[80:10 - 80:12] It, it does go to quality control.

[80:12 - 80:14] You can leverage that argument sometimes.

[80:14 - 80:17] Data security is a big one I use to try and push for it.

[80:18 - 80:20] And I, and I do think the one-stop shopping

[80:20 - 80:21] makes it easier for directors.

[80:21 - 80:23] So they're not saying, wait, where is this thing?

[80:23 - 80:26] And the things that we end up at the outside the portal tend

[80:26 - 80:28] to be things like succession planning

[80:29 - 80:30] where it's super sensitive

[80:30 - 80:32] and they don't want everyone to have access to it.

[80:32 - 80:34] And maybe that got sent by the CEO separately.

[80:35 - 80:36] It's not my preference,

[80:36 - 80:38] but it's a fight that I might not win.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[80:39 - 80:42] Yeah, I I often see friction in the adoption process

[80:43 - 80:47] directors who are not that tech savvy complaining about it

[80:47 - 80:48] or who just wanna work a certain way.

[80:49 - 80:51] And, you know, I think there's that initial adoption curve

[80:51 - 80:54] that can, can be painful and it does generate complaints,

[80:54 - 80:55] but it, it has value

[80:56 - 80:58] and benefits to the company if you can get people over the

[80:58 - 81:00] hump and working that way.

[81:01 - 81:03] The other place that comes up a lot is airplanes.

[81:04 - 81:07] Um, you know, I, I want to be able to get on the plane

[81:07 - 81:08] to fly to the board meeting

[81:08 - 81:11] and I wanna, you know, be able to have access to it in paper

[81:12 - 81:16] so I can read it or, you know, on my download from my iPad

[81:16 - 81:17] or something not logging into a portal.

[81:17 - 81:20] And to the extent it's pushing people to

[81:20 - 81:22] that, that's one Gotcha.

[81:22 - 81:24] That I think we haven't seen the end of yet is airplane,

[81:25 - 81:26] um, airplane internet.

[81:27 - 81:30] Um, you know, I am sure you've seen some of the studies

[81:30 - 81:32] and news stories with reporters who've managed

[81:32 - 81:35] to pull just crazy things off of the wifi

[81:35 - 81:36] that are floating around the cabin.

[81:37 - 81:39] And so, I mean, really your directors should not be

[81:40 - 81:43] on an internet reading anything confidential on the plane.

[81:43 - 81:44] 'cause it's, it's not secure.

[81:45 - 81:47] Um, I had a crazy situation where a director

[81:48 - 81:51] FaceTimed into a board meeting from an airplane, um,

[81:51 - 81:53] that bad behavior in multiple ways,

[81:53 - 81:55] but, uh, another one to watch out for.

[81:56 - 81:57] So

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[82:02 - 82:06] I was gonna ask a much more rudimentary question than the

[82:06 - 82:07] stuff you guys are all talking about.

[82:08 - 82:11] Okay. Um, so when I came into the company,

[82:12 - 82:14] there was no delegation of authority.

[82:14 - 82:16] There was no, like, there was just like, it was very,

[82:17 - 82:19] you know, early stage willy-nilly decision making.

[82:19 - 82:21] And I slowly sort of implemented

[82:22 - 82:25] what I would call like pretty minor controls,

[82:25 - 82:26] levels of controls.

[82:27 - 82:30] Like what's, where is there a playbook somewhere

[82:30 - 82:32] that I should be following to get from here to there?

[82:33 - 82:35] You know, I mean, I've looked

[82:35 - 82:36] on, you know, I've looked at, do

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[82:36 - 82:38] I remember Rachel, that you're and all

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[82:38 - 82:39] The tech GC sources,

[82:39 - 82:42] and honestly, it's hard to stomach paying a lawyer hundreds

[82:42 - 82:45] of dollars an hour to tell you what's like,

[82:45 - 82:47] mostly common sense stuff, right?

[82:48 - 82:49] But just figuring out how to get from here

[82:49 - 82:51] to there is a tough thing.

[82:51 - 82:55] Like you all are talking about portals for board members.

[82:55 - 82:58] Well, all of our board members are, you know, either the,

[82:59 - 83:04] the, the two co-founders or the investors, right?

[83:04 - 83:06] And those seats are just,

[83:06 - 83:08] are just appointed by those people.

[83:08 - 83:12] And so they're gonna get data daily communications from us.

[83:12 - 83:14] I can't control any of that, right?

[83:15 - 83:17] So we're in a really different place.

[83:18 - 83:20] And I, I've talked to a bunch of lawyers, lawyers

[83:20 - 83:23] that do other work for us, you know, at, at big law firms,

[83:23 - 83:25] what I would call fancy schmancy law firms.

[83:26 - 83:27] And their advice isn't particularly helpful

[83:27 - 83:29] because they're not used to dealing with a company

[83:29 - 83:32] of my size, um, or a stage.

[83:33 - 83:36] So what's the, you know, what's the playbook in, in

[83:36 - 83:37] to get from here to there, right?

[83:38 - 83:41] Say there's a plan to IPO in the next three to five years

[83:41 - 83:43] to get from here to there

[83:43 - 83:46] and to train people in those decision making processes

[83:46 - 83:47] so when they get there, they're ready.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[83:48 - 83:50] Yeah. I, I think it's incremental change, right?

[83:50 - 83:53] I mean, so I do see I'm maybe guilty of being part

[83:53 - 83:55] of a fancy schmancy law firm.

[83:55 - 83:58] Um, I, a lot of my clients are pure startups.

[83:58 - 84:01] They evolve exactly the way you're describing.

[84:01 - 84:04] And you know, I, I don't think you can,

[84:05 - 84:09] you can jump in at a series A round with one angel investor

[84:09 - 84:12] or you know, super angel or something and, and try

[84:12 - 84:15] and establish public company controls and procedures.

[84:15 - 84:19] But I think you want to see, um, the,

[84:19 - 84:20] the board governance process making

[84:21 - 84:22] progress along the way, right?

[84:22 - 84:26] So pick your battles, um, what's important, where, where,

[84:26 - 84:28] where is my, where are my biggest risks

[84:28 - 84:31] or where are decisions getting made that are outside

[84:31 - 84:32] of the eye shot of the board

[84:32 - 84:33] and that's gonna create a problem.

[84:33 - 84:37] And how do I start to channel that into board channels, um,

[84:38 - 84:40] and accept the fact that it's, you know,

[84:40 - 84:43] you can't boil the ocean and you can't change it overnight.

[84:43 - 84:46] Um, if I remember right Rachel, you have a,

[84:46 - 84:47] an acquirer who's coming in

[84:47 - 84:50] and they're gonna be establishing their own controls

[84:50 - 84:54] and procedures so that that may happen faster than, um, my,

[84:54 - 84:57] my guess is that there's gonna be a pretty clear, you know,

[84:57 - 84:59] edict from corporate about, you know,

[84:59 - 85:00] what the rules are now.

[85:00 - 85:03] Um, so that may be out, out of your hands in a way.

[85:04 - 85:07] Um, but I, but I think in general, as you evolve, you,

[85:07 - 85:10] it can't be a sudden last minute thing that, you know,

[85:10 - 85:13] you've, um, you've grown all the way from zero

[85:13 - 85:15] to 60 miles an hour without doing it

[85:15 - 85:17] and then suddenly, you know, turn it on.

[85:17 - 85:20] So I, I think you just make progress along the way.

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[85:20 - 85:22] I mean, part of the things I'm thinking about is wanting

[85:22 - 85:24] to know the answers before I'm told what the answers are.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[85:25 - 85:27] Yeah. And I think that's a big piece of it, Rachel. Right?

[85:27 - 85:29] Right. We might wanna set up a structure

[85:29 - 85:30] that you're comfortable with as a team

[85:30 - 85:31] about what would go to the board

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[85:32 - 85:35] Before, before we're told by our new investors, here's

[85:35 - 85:37] what we want and this is the structure we wanted in,

[85:38 - 85:40] but the upshot of that is I have to make it up

[85:41 - 85:42] and like it's ama

[85:43 - 85:45] and I don't know if anyone here has come across resources

[85:45 - 85:46] that are useful in that scenario,

[85:46 - 85:48] but like, I haven't done it before.

[85:48 - 85:50] I'm, this is a, my first time in this role,

[85:50 - 85:52] so I haven't done it before. Yeah.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[85:53 - 85:54] Put, put the question out to the group

[85:54 - 85:56] because there are good resources on this.

[85:56 - 85:59] We've always done it with a blend of sort of dollar limits,

[86:00 - 86:01] a question about whether authority is limited

[86:01 - 86:03] to subject matter area or not.

[86:03 - 86:06] Yeah. And then certain categories of things

[86:06 - 86:07] that have to go to the board.

[86:07 - 86:10] And that list is helpful both for somebody like you

[86:10 - 86:11] or me in the seat to know

[86:11 - 86:13] what things we have to take to the board.

[86:13 - 86:15] But it's also a way of giving the board kind of comfort

[86:15 - 86:17] of like, look, these are the big things you are gonna get

[86:17 - 86:20] to weigh in on them and these other things are gonna be

[86:20 - 86:23] operational or they're within budget or things like that.

[86:23 - 86:25] We're gonna be able to execute without

[86:25 - 86:26] necessarily coming back to you.

[86:26 - 86:29] And those tend to be easy to pick out

[86:29 - 86:31] because they're the things that would require board approval

[86:31 - 86:33] anyway, like putting in place a loan facility

[86:33 - 86:34] of a certain size, right?

[86:34 - 86:36] You're gonna go to the board doing an acquisition

[86:37 - 86:38] of a certain size, like those kinds of things.

[86:38 - 86:40] Like, that's like the sleeve.

[86:40 - 86:42] I'm happy to give that to the board, you know,

[86:43 - 86:45] a commercial agreement that's 4 million in spend,

[86:45 - 86:48] but it's in budget, you know,

[86:48 - 86:49] I don't think you should have to go to board for that.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[86:51 - 86:56] Yeah. One, this is not

[86:56 - 86:59] oriented the way you're asking, but one resource that comes

[86:59 - 87:01] to mind is the NVCA forms.

[87:01 - 87:03] You go to nvca.org, there's a,

[87:04 - 87:07] a model investor rights agreement in there that would have,

[87:07 - 87:09] you know, a whole list of things that

[87:10 - 87:13] VC directors think are important that they go to the board.

[87:13 - 87:15] And you could use that as a list to go through

[87:15 - 87:16] and decide whether you also do.

[87:17 - 87:20] Um, but that might give you sort of, you know, the,

[87:20 - 87:22] the catchall of possibilities.

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[87:24 - 87:28] Yeah. Corporation, we have a delegation of authority

[87:28 - 87:30] and we have those sorts of things.

[87:30 - 87:33] It's, it's in part just like setting that culture around

[87:33 - 87:35] what gets shared and what doesn't.

[87:35 - 87:38] And sometimes in some categories we overshare probably,

[87:38 - 87:40] and in other categories we unders share, right.

[87:40 - 87:44] And it's trying to figure out how to, how to, how

[87:44 - 87:45] to guide that in the right direction.

[87:45 - 87:48] Mm-hmm. Um, which is, is tough without, you know,

[87:48 - 87:51] there's like most things that we, we, we do,

[87:51 - 87:52] we have rules, right?

[87:52 - 87:54] And this is a very, it's very amorphous.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[87:55 - 87:59] Mm-hmm. Well this has been a really helpful

[87:59 - 88:01] conversation and I think Tara would tell us

[88:01 - 88:04] that we're running up in time, um,

[88:04 - 88:05] and probably should wrap up.

[88:05 - 88:06] So I'll turn it back to you, Tara.

**[Speaker 0.0]**


[88:08 - 88:10] Yes. I, um,

[88:10 - 88:13] just wanna reiterate thank you everyone for joining.

[88:13 - 88:17] Um, I put this code for CLE in the chat.

[88:17 - 88:19] I'll also be following a post event.

[88:19 - 88:21] There are a couple articles that were shared,

[88:21 - 88:23] so we'll include those as well.

[88:23 - 88:27] Uh, but thank you to Jolie for being our tech GC host

[88:27 - 88:30] for the evening, and thank you to Alan

[88:30 - 88:33] and Kat from Fenwick for sponsoring this event.

[88:34 - 88:37] Um, their contact information will also be included in the

[88:37 - 88:38] post event email.

[88:39 - 88:42] Um, and this was a great conversation.

[88:42 - 88:46] Hopefully you all, uh, found it very valuable

[88:46 - 88:48] and, um, thanks for your time tonight.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[88:50 - 88:51] Thanks everyone. Thanks everyone.

[88:51 - 88:52] Enjoyed meeting with you.
