**[Speaker 1.0]**


[67.885 - 69.595] Thank you, Tara. So looking forward

[69.615 - 70.835] to this conversation tonight,

[70.895 - 73.115] and excited to have all of you guys joining us as well.

[73.855 - 76.035] My name is, as you said, is Jolie Siegel.

[76.055 - 78.435] I'm the Chief Legal Officer at C four Therapeutics,

[78.435 - 81.355] which is a company working on creating a new class of

[81.955 - 83.755] degrader medications for oncology

[83.855 - 85.635] and other, uh, therapeutic areas.

[86.415 - 88.755] And I've been with the company since June last year.

[89.075 - 91.555] I joined, uh, a couple weeks after a series B,

[92.175 - 95.955] and we immediately launched into an IPO, which closed, uh,

[96.295 - 97.715] 90 days after that.

[97.775 - 101.515] So in my first 120 days an IPO, that was interesting.

[102.055 - 103.635] Um, and since then we've gone on

[103.635 - 105.475] to get our first trial into the clinic

[105.615 - 107.955] and also do a follow on financing, uh, even

[107.955 - 109.155] before S3 eligibility.

[109.155 - 110.915] So it's been a busy and eventful year.

[111.575 - 113.275] On a personal note, on top of all that,

[113.395 - 115.555] I went on maternity leave at the end of May,

[115.695 - 118.315] so I'm finishing that up and go back to work next week.

[119.055 - 120.795] So, uh, lots of stuff going on,

[120.795 - 122.835] but did decide to tip my toes in the water

[122.835 - 125.155] with a board meeting this past week to just try

[125.155 - 127.795] and listen in 'cause I can't get enough of board dynamics.

[128.335 - 129.795] So that's sort of my background.

[130.055 - 133.075] Uh, we've got really great leadership from Fenwick with Alan

[133.075 - 134.715] and Kat on the line with us today,

[134.815 - 137.515] and they're gonna take us through a number of topics

[137.585 - 139.875] that we've thought about in terms of how to manage

[139.975 - 141.835] and get the most out of your board.

[142.495 - 143.595] Of course, as always,

[143.855 - 146.995] the best discussion come from comes from us asking questions

[147.095 - 149.915] and us sort of pushing through different scenarios

[149.995 - 151.115] and getting each other's input.

[151.135 - 153.195] So I would ask that folks, please chime in

[153.195 - 155.555] and let's make this as interactive as we possibly can.

[156.895 - 159.595] But I just wanna, you know, at the outset, thank the f team

[159.595 - 161.195] for their sponsorship, the event tonight.

[161.195 - 162.715] And I'll turn it over to Alan and Ka

[162.715 - 163.875] and let them introduce themselves.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[169.515 - 172.165] Yeah, say I'll go first. Uh, so thanks Julie.

[172.425 - 173.925] Uh, so my name is Kat Duncan.

[173.985 - 176.165] I'm a corporate partner at Fenwick and West.

[176.465 - 178.925] Um, I guess just a little bit about me first,

[179.065 - 181.405] and then I'll speak just really briefly about Fenwick.

[181.905 - 184.125] Um, so I just made a partner this year

[184.545 - 186.845] and, uh, so exciting milestone for me.

[187.305 - 189.685] Uh, and I've been at Fenwick for over 10 years.

[190.065 - 193.445] Uh, I, my practice is predominantly, uh, capital markets

[193.585 - 196.005] and working with public companies as well as working with,

[196.185 - 197.525] uh, private companies.

[197.985 - 199.525] Uh, on the public company side.

[199.685 - 202.245] I just completed taking, uh, Remitly Public.

[202.545 - 205.365] Uh, they had first day of trading last Thursday.

[205.905 - 208.565] Um, and I've worked with Alan on, uh, Redfin

[208.565 - 210.725] and Smartsheet, uh, here in the Seattle market.

[211.385 - 212.525] Uh, and then I also work

[212.525 - 215.005] with other public companies like Chegg and DocuSign.

[215.585 - 218.605] Um, on the private company side, I work with a number of,

[218.865 - 221.165] uh, later stage, uh, private companies

[221.165 - 222.365] that are in the consumer space.

[222.385 - 225.285] So like a Madison Reed, which does hair color primary kids,

[225.285 - 226.325] which does kids clothes.

[226.825 - 228.685] Uh, and I also work with a number of, uh,

[228.685 - 229.925] video gaming startups.

[230.425 - 234.485] Um, Fenwick, uh, is a firm that I'm sure, uh, I think,

[234.605 - 236.405] I think there's actually one client on the line.

[236.665 - 239.765] Uh, but we're a tech and life sciences, uh, law firm.

[239.905 - 243.005] So been around for over 50 years with, uh,

[243.325 - 244.565] presence up and down the west coast.

[244.665 - 247.405] So we've got offices in, you know, San Francisco,

[247.565 - 249.805] mountain View, Santa Monica, Seattle, as well as New York,

[249.805 - 252.045] and we're going to open a DC office as well.

[252.665 - 255.485] Um, our bread and butter is working with, uh, you know,

[255.535 - 258.565] technology and life sciences companies doing everything from

[258.565 - 262.165] corporate work, financing, employment, uh, you know,

[262.165 - 266.005] intellectual property, uh, doing licensing agreements, uh,

[266.145 - 269.885] you know, patents, litigation tax, uh, so anything

[269.885 - 272.765] and everything to service our, uh, our tech clients.

[273.705 - 275.365] So with that, I'll hand it over to Alan.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[276.565 - 279.265] Thanks. Um, I think Kat, uh, painted

[279.335 - 281.665] that picture pretty well, so there's not a lot left

[281.665 - 282.825] for me, but that's appropriate.

[283.005 - 285.665] Um, yeah, I'm, I'm both a, a practicing attorney

[285.685 - 287.265] and also I'm the chair of our corporate group.

[287.285 - 291.025] So I helped open the Seattle office for Fenwick in 2008

[291.725 - 294.185] and been practicing for about 25 years working

[294.215 - 297.185] with technology and life sciences companies of all stages.

[297.525 - 300.745] My mission is to find the next great startups, grow 'em up,

[300.775 - 303.985] help 'em raise money, go public, buy other companies,

[304.005 - 306.665] and then many of 'em get sold down the other side.

[306.895 - 310.785] I've worked with a lot of our regions, uh, leading, uh,

[310.785 - 312.105] public companies over the years.

[312.405 - 315.265] Uh, my most recent IPOs are Smartsheet

[315.265 - 317.505] and Redfin, that cat already alluded to Impel,

[317.645 - 319.065] neurop Pharma earlier this year.

[319.285 - 322.705] And, um, have had a, a, a lot

[322.705 - 324.385] of board experiences over the years, good

[324.385 - 326.625] and bad, from shareholder activism

[326.845 - 331.705] to hostile takeover defense, to board conflicts, um,

[332.045 - 334.785] you know, tricky executive terminations.

[335.005 - 337.305] So, um, we can certainly tell war stories

[337.445 - 339.825] or probably come up with scenarios

[339.825 - 341.385] and help answer your questions that you,

[341.525 - 342.825] you may have look forward to your questions.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[346.415 - 348.785] Awesome. So I think the form effort

[348.785 - 349.865] tonight, just a couple things.

[349.925 - 352.505] One, well, I have some questions that I can put to Alan

[352.505 - 354.145] and Kat that we can go through, but

[354.145 - 356.745] before we do that, we'll follow through on our usual format

[356.805 - 358.005] of doing introductions.

[358.585 - 360.765] So I, I've given my introduction, we'll ask folks

[360.765 - 362.765] to introduce themselves, give a second

[362.765 - 364.405] or two on who their, what their company is,

[364.465 - 367.405] and then one challenge that you're currently facing, uh,

[367.405 - 369.325] bonus points if it ties into our topic

[369.425 - 370.845] of board matters today.

[371.225 - 373.525] So I'll give you my one challenge that I'm thinking about.

[374.025 - 378.405] You know, we've got a, um, ex a an engaged board

[378.405 - 380.725] of directors, but we don't have, uh, a lot

[380.725 - 382.885] of public company director experience on our board.

[383.265 - 385.045] So thinking about how to keep our board

[385.345 - 388.325] as well educated about what's topical and important today

[388.345 - 391.365] and what investors are expecting from directors is something

[391.365 - 392.485] that I'm always thinking about.

[393.705 - 396.245] And I'll turn over, I'm gonna go on my screen to Christine,

[396.375 - 397.885] who's first one up for me.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[398.895 - 399.955] Hi, everybody. Good evening.

[400.135 - 402.635] Um, happy to, to join this group.

[403.255 - 405.275] Um, so I just joined at Fire

[405.455 - 408.435] as its first general council, uh, three weeks ago.

[408.975 - 412.275] And we have our first, uh, board meeting coming up.

[412.275 - 413.435] Well, I should, I should say,

[413.515 - 415.595] I have my first board meeting coming up the first

[415.595 - 416.675] week of October.

[416.895 - 419.395] So this topic is very timely for me.

[419.855 - 422.955] Uh, previous to at fire, I was general counsel at Acquia.

[423.035 - 424.115] I was there for eight years.

[424.935 - 426.955] Um, so it's, it's nice to see all of you

[426.955 - 428.595] and I, I look forward to the discussion.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[432.735 - 434.195] And Christine, why don't you pick somebody

[434.335 - 435.755] and we'll just keep passing it around.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[436.135 - 439.515] Uh, so yeah, I'll, I'll pass the baton to, I think Kat is

[439.575 - 440.715] to the right of my screen.

[441.055 - 444.155] Oh, no, sorry. That's, uh, Fenwick. Sorry. Uh, it's Karen.

[444.735 - 445.735] Hi, Karen.

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[447.855 - 449.515] Hi, I'm Karen Tepi chain.

[449.695 - 452.595] Um, I am general counsel at Ginkgo Bioworks.

[453.095 - 455.755] Um, we're a biotechnology company

[455.845 - 457.755] where we're building a platform

[457.975 - 461.075] to program cells like you can program computers.

[461.615 - 464.555] Um, and we also have a COVID-19 testing, um,

[465.255 - 467.035] uh, you know, business unit.

[467.735 - 472.355] Uh, so we recently completed, um, a business combination

[472.585 - 476.275] with a spac, so we're now a public company as

[476.275 - 477.395] of September 16th.

[477.655 - 480.595] So I think our board issues, um,

[480.595 - 483.315] that we're facing is really like, you know,

[483.375 - 486.515] how do we move from being this private company board

[486.565 - 490.595] where really, like a lot of the executive team had, um,

[491.025 - 495.355] ownership and, um, decision making authority over lots

[495.355 - 498.155] of the different kinds of transactions we do to

[498.335 - 502.555] how do you like, create like, um, solid governance, um, uh,

[502.755 - 505.035] a solid governance and a solid relationship with the board,

[505.455 - 508.955] um, to efficiently continue business as we have done it.

**[Speaker 6.0]**


[513.825 - 515.365] So I'm another Karen, I wasn't sure

[515.365 - 516.525] which Karen you were calling out.

[516.585 - 519.125] So I'll, um,

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[519.425 - 520.425] Hi Karen.

**[Speaker 6.0]**


[520.425 - 522.085] I'm Karen Galley. I'm, um,

[522.085 - 524.245] general Counsel at Ika America Pharmaceutical.

[524.485 - 526.805] I am new to Tech gc. This is my first event.

[527.465 - 531.245] Um, Ika is a, um, pharmaceutical company.

[531.295 - 533.365] We're also in, um, the digital space.

[533.385 - 537.005] We have the first FDA, um, product approved,

[537.015 - 540.165] which is a chip in a pill, um, called Abilify, my site.

[540.825 - 543.645] Um, and we're looking at other digital opportunities.

[543.785 - 546.565] So that prompted me to join, um, challenge.

[546.705 - 548.245] So, so we're privately held.

[548.305 - 552.005] We just had our, our parent company in Japan just kicked off

[552.105 - 555.485] our 100th year celebration or hundredth anniversary year.

[555.585 - 558.565] So, you know, we're well established

[558.625 - 560.165] and not seeking funding.

[560.305 - 561.885] And so I think I'm in a different space,

[561.905 - 563.125] or I'm handling different issues

[563.195 - 565.005] than many of you on the call.

[565.065 - 566.885] But, um, one of the challenges that we have is

[566.885 - 568.885] because we're privately held and we're long standing,

[568.985 - 571.645] our board is very known to us.

[572.025 - 573.645] Um, and we are working on expanding that

[573.645 - 576.285] and going through the process of identifying potential

[576.285 - 579.445] candidates and, um, you know,

[579.635 - 581.405] looking more for different voices.

[584.085 - 586.185] Um, so I am gonna call Efrin.

**[Speaker 7.0]**


[589.385 - 590.995] Good evening everyone. My name's Fen Garcia.

[591.415 - 594.555] I'm A-C-L-O-C-C-O here at Southwest Key Programs.

[595.015 - 596.955] Uh, before I tell you about what Southwest Key does,

[597.075 - 599.155] I actually started off as a patent litigator, uh,

[599.155 - 600.475] which is the reason I joined Tech tc.

[600.475 - 601.555] I wanna stay close to my roots.

[601.735 - 604.075] Uh, did patent litigation for 10 years

[604.075 - 606.835] before joining a smog company here in Austin, uh,

[607.315 - 610.755] software slash IT company, and did a, was their GC

[610.815 - 612.595] and their, uh, VP

[612.595 - 614.675] of community resources for five, six years.

[615.375 - 616.955] Uh, then had an interesting opportunity

[616.955 - 618.515] to join the current organization where I'm at.

[618.785 - 622.035] It's, uh, 8,000 strong, uh, organization, uh,

[622.355 - 625.155] employee strong organization that serves about 5,000

[625.155 - 627.075] unaccompanied minors at any given time.

[627.735 - 630.795] Uh, so it's a, it's a very unique organization

[631.375 - 634.115] and, uh, like I said, I joined Tech DC too

[634.315 - 637.115] 'cause I do still enjoy the technical aspects of, of law.

[637.415 - 639.915] Uh, one of the biggest issues I was brought on board

[639.915 - 641.475] for many reasons, but the biggest is kind

[641.475 - 643.875] of transformed the organization, uh, from the inside out.

[643.875 - 645.795] And one of the biggest issues that I've encountered is

[646.315 - 647.675] a board that is, uh,

[648.345 - 651.115] some legacy board members had causes some heartburn.

[651.415 - 655.115] And so trying to gently ask them to, Hey,

[655.215 - 656.235] you might wanna look somewhere else.

[656.255 - 659.315] And so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on how to

[660.275 - 661.555] transform a board, uh,

[661.555 - 664.115] when board members may be reticent to leave.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[668.375 - 669.635] All right. Who are you calling on next?

**[Speaker 7.0]**


[671.895 - 673.835] Uh, Dustin Carlton.

**[Speaker 8.0]**


[676.105 - 677.285] Hey, how's everybody doing?

[677.585 - 680.965] Uh, as he mentioned Dustin Carlton. I'm from Bellhop.

[681.025 - 683.405] I'm the VP of Legal and Compliance.

[684.035 - 686.045] I've been at the company for about three years.

[686.105 - 687.245] I'm in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

[688.025 - 692.645] Um, one of the reasons why I'm here at this, um,

[693.145 - 695.645] dinner seminar, um,

[696.825 - 699.165] is I don't actually have a corporate background.

[699.565 - 702.085] I was, uh, labor and employment, uh, prior

[702.085 - 703.485] to going in-house.

[704.345 - 708.925] And, um, so I'm always feeling like I'm ill-equipped, uh,

[708.925 - 711.925] to some extent, um, in the boardroom.

[712.105 - 714.805] So I think it's just helpful to surround myself

[714.805 - 718.365] as much education as possible on, on, uh, board matters.

[719.725 - 723.585] And one of the, well, there's a lot of issues, of course,

[723.585 - 726.265] running around, um, the company.

[726.405 - 729.225] But, um, you know,

[729.225 - 731.265] next year we'll be seeking some additional funding

[731.365 - 735.985] and I'm, I'm looking for additional ways just to better, um,

[737.705 - 740.695] equip the, the company going into our, our next fundraise.

[741.555 - 743.335] Um, so both with respect to the board

[743.335 - 745.295] and with respect to the just general company matters.

[748.075 - 752.125] And I'll call on, uh, Robin.

[752.665 - 754.125] No, I think you went, didn't you?

[758.605 - 759.785] No, I haven't said any Yet.

[759.785 - 760.865] Okay. I didn't have your name written down.

**[Speaker 9.0]**


[761.465 - 764.105] I was like, wait. That's okay. That's alright.

[764.765 - 767.985] Um, I'm general counsel for a company called Token X

[768.765 - 771.185] and we tokenize sensitive data.

[771.365 - 774.545] So, um, structured and semi-structured.

[775.045 - 778.545] Um, it could be, um, bank account numbers,

[778.545 - 781.945] social security numbers, phone numbers, credit card numbers,

[782.325 - 787.025] um, started out, um, as a PCI compliance solution,

[788.125 - 789.705] but it's gotten broader than that.

[790.525 - 794.785] And in our company, we're a, you know, compared to you guys

[794.785 - 797.385] with 8,000 employees, we're a very small tech company,

[798.285 - 800.225] but right in the middle of due diligence

[800.445 - 801.745] for a round of funding.

[802.365 - 805.665] And so, um, like Dustin said,

[806.505 - 809.025] I don't have a heavy corporate governance

[809.355 - 810.865] background and exposure.

[811.105 - 815.585] I have a heavy tech contracting, et cetera, et cetera,

[815.855 - 818.505] liaison with technical people background,

[819.405 - 823.225] and our board, um, I suspect it's about to change

[823.335 - 824.705] with another round of funding.

[825.565 - 828.225] And, um, it's one of those situations

[828.225 - 831.185] where I haven't had any exposure to our board,

[832.325 - 833.625] but they know that, uh,

[833.645 - 835.865] our leadership team knows that I would like that.

[836.365 - 839.065] And so I'm kind of preparing for the day that all

[839.065 - 840.585] of a sudden they flip the switch on

[840.885 - 843.185] and say, oh, okay, well now how about you come over here.

[844.045 - 846.065] Our former general counsel is a shareholder

[846.845 - 848.105] and he is on the board.

[849.375 - 850.875] So, um, there's,

[850.935 - 855.035] and he's been there from day one, so, um,

[855.535 - 857.795] that's why I am not involved in the board at this time.

[859.945 - 863.005] And let's see. And who hasn't gone yet?

[865.145 - 869.855] Um, how about Renee Hunter?

**[Speaker 10.0]**


[872.545 - 875.465] I was getting nervous I was gonna be the last picked, uh,

[875.465 - 877.825] it felt like I was back in kickball in elementary school.

[878.005 - 880.345] Uh, so Renee Hunter with Notarize, uh,

[880.405 - 883.825] we provide remote online notarization services, uh,

[883.845 - 887.945] in addition to identity proofing services, uh, as well

[887.945 - 890.625] as active software as a service for companies

[890.625 - 892.975] who wanna bring their own notaries on the platform

[892.975 - 895.255] and provide their own remote noter services.

[895.675 - 900.335] So, um, not as streamlined as initially thought.

[900.695 - 902.615] I joined notarized from the Quicken

[902.615 - 903.735] Loans family of companies.

[903.935 - 906.255] I have been part of every, uh, the passing

[906.315 - 909.975] of every single remote notarization law except

[910.055 - 911.495] for Virginia in 2011.

[912.275 - 915.895] Um, so since 2016 have been working with legislators

[915.895 - 920.135] and regulators and, uh, setting forth new legislation.

[920.925 - 922.255] That being said, I say that

[922.255 - 925.255] because that is where I, whether I should admit

[925.255 - 926.335] that's my area of expertise

[926.335 - 928.255] or not, that's my area of expertise.

[928.915 - 930.695] Um, working with a board,

[930.695 - 932.575] even though I was general counsel at my past company,

[932.675 - 933.815] we were privately held

[933.955 - 936.375] and it was a very different scenario at the time.

[937.155 - 939.815] So wanting to learn more about how to work better

[939.815 - 942.335] with the board, and quite honestly, how do you kick some,

[942.335 - 943.775] some of the extra observers

[943.775 - 946.415] and like visitors off the board when they just keep showing

[946.615 - 948.175] up to the meeting and do it politely.

[948.325 - 950.135] Like, if you only have one observer seat,

[950.275 - 952.095] you should only bring one person, not three.

[952.635 - 954.735] So I love to hear how some of you have handled

[954.735 - 956.455] that in the past, and maybe it's just as blunt

[956.515 - 957.655] as you can't all come.

[958.165 - 960.015] This is a not a 17 person meeting.

[966.385 - 970.445] I'm next. Um, David Morris, did you speak yet?

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[971.105 - 973.485] No, not yet. Uh, hey, uh, David Morris,

[973.485 - 975.165] general Counsel for Vivid Seats.

[975.535 - 978.045] Vivid Seats is an online ticketing marketplace

[978.185 - 980.605] for live sports concert and event tickets.

[981.425 - 985.925] And we are in the midst of going public over the next couple

[985.925 - 987.685] of weeks through a SPAC process.

[988.395 - 991.045] Just had our S four declared effective.

[991.045 - 994.685] So we're just a couple weeks behind, uh, Karen, where?

[994.735 - 996.725] Karen, Karen TI should say.

[997.265 - 1001.605] Um, so my background is kind of corporate transactional,

[1001.625 - 1003.005] but not on the governance side.

[1003.505 - 1006.805] So for me, coming into a new public company board,

[1007.115 - 1009.125] putting all of our governance in place,

[1009.905 - 1012.165] and I came in kind of halfway through the SPAC process,

[1013.025 - 1016.685] trying to learn as much as I can about setting the right

[1017.525 - 1020.805] standards, uh, and processes upfront, since I have a chance

[1020.805 - 1022.285] to do this from scratch, as most

[1022.285 - 1024.485] of our private company board is not part

[1024.485 - 1026.245] of the public company board going forward.

[1029.955 - 1032.735] Uh, let's see, who else has not gone yet?

[1032.795 - 1035.015] How about Steven, have you gone yet?

**[Speaker 12.0]**


[1035.635 - 1038.775] No, I have not. Thank you. Uh, my name is Steven Quinlan.

[1038.775 - 1041.095] I'm head of legal for Boston Gene Corporation.

[1041.755 - 1043.735] Uh, what we do is we own

[1043.755 - 1048.255] and use proprietary software, um, to analyze sequencing data

[1048.675 - 1051.815] for, um, tissue specimens of cancer for,

[1051.875 - 1053.975] to assist oncologists and treatment decisions.

[1054.795 - 1057.295] Um, and so we're a relatively small company.

[1057.395 - 1060.695] The board is just three members right now, one investor

[1060.795 - 1065.255] who we brought on as part of our Series A financing, um,

[1065.435 - 1069.605] and essentially, um, other, uh, founders of the company.

[1070.225 - 1072.365] Um, but we will be seeking investment soon.

[1072.465 - 1075.245] And so one of the major hurdles that, you know,

[1075.245 - 1077.325] we'll be facing in the near future is how

[1077.325 - 1079.645] to really professionalize, um,

[1079.985 - 1084.765] and I guess level up the board, uh, for the purpose of the,

[1085.065 - 1086.925] um, new investors that will be brought in

[1086.925 - 1089.165] and the kind of oversight that we'll be anticipating.

[1090.785 - 1093.365] Um, so I guess I'll move on here.

[1093.685 - 1096.245] I has Rachel Goldwasser gone

[1096.305 - 1100.515] yet. Okay. I

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[1100.515 - 1102.915] Haven't, let me just fum fumble for the mute button.

[1103.095 - 1106.755] Um, Um,

[1107.715 - 1109.915] I am the, uh, GC

[1109.975 - 1112.795] and VP for regulatory at Key Capture Energy.

[1112.925 - 1116.435] We're, um, a little different than some tech GC companies.

[1116.535 - 1118.835] We, um, build and then operate, um,

[1119.255 - 1121.115] big batteries on the electric grid

[1122.085 - 1124.945] and, um, we're privately held, um,

[1125.325 - 1129.145] and just announced a couple weeks ago that we are going

[1129.145 - 1132.465] to be acquired by a Korean conglomerate.

[1133.085 - 1135.745] Um, so we're gonna, we're in a similar place

[1135.745 - 1137.145] to some other folks, although we aren't

[1137.145 - 1138.385] gonna be public in that.

[1138.485 - 1141.185] I'm thinking through what our, um,

[1141.535 - 1143.065] manager's relationships will be

[1143.445 - 1147.145] and what kinds of approvals they're expecting to have

[1147.565 - 1150.825] and what's gonna, what is gonna change in terms

[1150.825 - 1152.425] of the processes that we followed.

[1153.065 - 1156.745] I joined the company almost two years ago and, um, the CEO

[1156.745 - 1159.225] and COO had a pretty well established relationship

[1159.225 - 1160.785] with their current investors.

[1161.085 - 1164.185] And so I've played a pretty light role in terms

[1164.305 - 1167.625] of making sure as an l you know, as an LLC with a small

[1168.165 - 1170.025] manage, you know, group of managers.

[1170.165 - 1174.055] Pretty limited role in terms of, um, guiding them, um,

[1174.115 - 1177.175] in corporate, um, structure and governance.

[1177.195 - 1180.335] But I think that in this next round of relationships,

[1181.105 - 1183.255] those items are gonna be much more important.

[1183.435 - 1185.615] So really interested in, in the conversation

[1185.615 - 1187.775] and hearing about people's experience.

[1188.675 - 1192.575] Um, Meredith, have you, have you introduced yourself?

[1192.615 - 1193.615] I don't think you have.

**[Speaker 14.0]**


[1194.495 - 1197.355] No. Hi, I am Meredith Fuchs. I'm General Counsel Plaid.

[1197.405 - 1201.475] We're, uh, a financial services, um,

[1201.645 - 1203.635] technology infrastructure company.

[1204.495 - 1206.915] And, um, I'm interested in many

[1206.915 - 1208.355] of the topics people have raised.

[1208.735 - 1211.075] Um, I'd say probably one

[1211.075 - 1213.075] of the things I'm thinking about is kind

[1213.075 - 1217.195] of transitioning from a mainly investor, um,

[1217.385 - 1221.875] populated board to one that's, um, got independent,

[1222.335 - 1225.395] uh, directors and sort of the kind of reporting

[1225.395 - 1229.275] and expectations to, to kind of get the board to

[1229.275 - 1230.915] where they will, you know,

[1230.945 - 1232.755] they should be if we were a public company.

[1233.215 - 1234.955] But, um, many of these topics are

[1234.955 - 1236.155] very interesting, so thank you.

[1237.755 - 1238.935] Oh, I'm supposed to pick someone.

[1239.835 - 1242.965] Um, let's see.

[1244.145 - 1246.375] Diana, Diane, did you hear

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[1246.375 - 1247.375] Her? Diana, that's me, yes.

[1247.375 - 1250.045] Hi everyone. I'm, I'm Diane ui.

[1250.065 - 1251.925] I'm general counsel of ezCater.

[1252.245 - 1254.285] ezCater is an online marketplace

[1254.425 - 1256.485] for ordering corporate catering.

[1257.375 - 1259.685] We're a private VC-backed company.

[1260.105 - 1263.205] Uh, board currently consists of eight members, a couple

[1263.205 - 1266.045] of founders, couple of independents

[1266.105 - 1269.285] and four investors as well as, uh, a couple

[1269.285 - 1274.165] of board observers where potentially, um,

[1274.295 - 1276.125] going public in a year or two.

[1276.125 - 1277.925] Nothing currently on the horizon,

[1278.185 - 1280.405] but, um, starting to think about that

[1280.505 - 1281.645] and trying to think about

[1281.645 - 1284.205] what we would wanna be doing from a,

[1284.405 - 1286.245] a board perspective in connection with that.

[1286.765 - 1289.645] I do have a, a, a general corporate background, uh,

[1289.705 - 1292.845] was previously at a company called care.com

[1293.145 - 1296.645] and took that company public in 2014, uh,

[1296.745 - 1297.805] and continued there for

[1297.805 - 1298.925] another five years as a public company.

[1299.065 - 1303.565] So, uh, I have experience, uh, with public company boards

[1303.625 - 1304.725] and what the requirements are,

[1304.785 - 1306.965] but thought a refresher would be, would be good.

[1311.105 - 1313.845] So, I'm sorry I joined late, so I don't know

[1313.985 - 1316.085] who has not gone yet.

[1316.155 - 1318.285] Just can anyone raise their hand if they haven't gone?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[1319.515 - 1321.595] I think it's rake an anshu, right?

[1321.855 - 1325.205] If I got pronunciations right and Sarah,

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[1325.475 - 1326.475] Okay. Okay.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[1331.115 - 1333.235] I can go if no one will volunteer.

[1334.815 - 1337.235] Hey guys, I'm general counsel

[1337.295 - 1340.235] and corporate secretary for Aztec Industries Inc.

[1341.125 - 1342.625] Uh, we are a public company.

[1344.025 - 1347.805] We are sort of an old dumb company, uh,

[1348.345 - 1351.285] but trying to heavily invest in technology

[1352.305 - 1355.645] and, uh, sort of follow the adage, right?

[1355.745 - 1357.005] You are either a tech company,

[1357.905 - 1360.085] you are either turning into a tech company

[1360.145 - 1361.885] or being replaced by a tech company.

[1362.305 - 1363.965] So we are trying to not be replaced

[1364.465 - 1366.365] and hopefully turn into a tech company.

[1367.665 - 1371.285] Um, like I said, we've been a public company.

[1371.495 - 1373.805] We've actually been a public company for, um,

[1375.675 - 1377.395] I wanna say about 40 years.

[1378.055 - 1379.995] But, but therein lies a little bit of the rub.

[1380.415 - 1383.595] Um, our company has only had

[1384.495 - 1386.835] two CEOs before the current CEO

[1387.295 - 1389.195] and both of those CEOs were sort of the,

[1389.655 - 1391.955] one was the founder owner, the other was his son.

[1392.975 - 1396.155] So the board members sort of,

[1397.645 - 1400.525] I think if you look at, um,

[1402.315 - 1405.205] look at a lot of, you know, literature on boards, you know,

[1406.105 - 1409.885] um, and if you sort of did the, the cature

[1409.885 - 1412.605] of old school board, that would be our board.

[1412.625 - 1415.245] You can go and take a look at our website.

[1416.195 - 1420.835] Um, we are going through a transformation of our board,

[1421.175 - 1425.445] or the next three years we'll be transitioning six members,

[1426.655 - 1428.515] um, and working with Nam

[1428.515 - 1432.995] and gut chair to sort of, um, action the plan in place,

[1433.505 - 1436.545] help the CEO, um, we,

[1436.565 - 1438.825] the new board member candidates and so on and so forth.

[1438.825 - 1440.065] So that's sort of my role.

[1440.885 - 1445.385] Um, my background is, uh, sort

[1445.385 - 1448.255] of a little bit of mostly corporate, uh,

[1448.285 - 1450.935] started my career early on with public company m

[1450.935 - 1453.915] and a, then worked on private m and a,

[1454.055 - 1458.755] and then went, um, to, uh, to a Midwest based,

[1458.935 - 1462.155] uh, law firm doing both middle market m

[1462.155 - 1467.095] and a as well as corporate, um, corporate, um, uh,

[1467.405 - 1469.175] transactional work, um,

[1469.175 - 1471.175] commercial agreements and stuff like that.

[1471.395 - 1473.735] So that's what brought me,

[1474.035 - 1476.255] or those experiences sort of brought me here.

[1476.315 - 1480.245] Now, um, with that, I'll pass it on to

[1481.185 - 1482.645] if I got the pronunciation right.

**[Speaker 17.0]**


[1485.635 - 1488.975] You did. Thank you. Um, hi, my name is Rika Rin.

[1489.575 - 1492.535] I am currently the general counsel of a Susu Financial.

[1497.835 - 1502.015] um, that is dedicated to using data to bridge the wealth,

[1502.395 - 1503.775] the racial wealth gap in America.

[1504.155 - 1505.775] One of our key products right now

[1505.775 - 1509.415] that we're really scaling up on is rent reporting, um,

[1510.195 - 1512.975] for tenants and multifamily properties.

[1513.395 - 1516.735] Um, we started off with like a B2C model.

[1516.795 - 1519.575] Now we're a B2B model really working with, um, property

[1520.375 - 1524.695] managers and owner operators to sign on their residents

[1524.715 - 1529.255] to report positive, um, rental payment history in order to,

[1529.635 - 1532.095] um, create credit scores so people are credit invisible

[1532.235 - 1536.255] and to boost credit scores for people who don't, um, who,

[1536.435 - 1538.255] who currently have fair to good credit.

[1538.305 - 1542.175] Right? Um, we're pretty small company.

[1542.315 - 1543.575] I'm the first general council.

[1543.995 - 1548.215] We just, um, earlier this summer closed our series a fin,

[1548.235 - 1552.375] um, finance, um, financing round, um, a funding round.

[1553.115 - 1555.455] We are, we just had our first board meeting.

[1555.455 - 1558.975] That was the first one I've ever, um, participated in

[1559.035 - 1560.215] as corporate secretary.

[1560.795 - 1564.215] Um, learning a lot, took meeting notes. That was fun.

[1564.715 - 1568.295] Um, so I think what I'm, really think what I'm considering

[1568.315 - 1572.175] as we, um, are as we start talking about, um, you know,

[1572.865 - 1575.975] later funding series is just looking at like the bylaws.

[1575.975 - 1580.935] And my challenge is trying to, you know, the board was, uh,

[1580.935 - 1584.135] initially comprised of the co uh, the co-founders

[1585.305 - 1587.365] and now we're getting investors on the board.

[1587.865 - 1589.325] And initially a lot

[1589.325 - 1591.165] of the powers are seated at the board level.

[1591.265 - 1593.805] And just, you know, having an understanding of how

[1593.805 - 1596.365] to like balance what's, like what we should,

[1596.515 - 1599.165] what we should go to a corporate, like to go

[1599.345 - 1600.845] to the executive level, right?

[1600.865 - 1603.935] Powers that should be seated to the executive sources, um,

[1603.935 - 1605.295] powers that should be seated to the board.

[1605.355 - 1606.615] So if any kind of insight

[1606.615 - 1607.815] into that would be extremely helpful.

[1608.355 - 1609.975] And last, but certainly not least,

[1610.315 - 1611.775] um, I hand it over to Sarah.

**[Speaker 19.0]**


[1614.675 - 1616.535] Hi. Uh, if you see people walking

[1616.535 - 1617.735] around in the background, sorry about that

[1618.515 - 1619.615] center time over here.

[1620.115 - 1621.295] Uh, my name is Sarah Weatherhead.

[1621.295 - 1624.535] I'm the general counsel at Maven Clinic, and we are a family

[1624.955 - 1627.735] and, um, maternity health

[1628.945 - 1632.735] telehealth product, a platform, um, sold primarily

[1632.735 - 1634.695] through employers, but also, um,

[1634.695 - 1636.135] more recently through health plans.

[1636.675 - 1641.095] Um, and, um, I have to say

[1641.125 - 1642.255] that in listening

[1642.255 - 1644.775] to everyone's comments on their board questions,

[1644.915 - 1646.135] we are Series D by the way,

[1646.135 - 1647.575] we just closed our Series D this summer.

[1648.155 - 1649.935] Um, I have to say that in listening

[1649.995 - 1654.575] to people's comments on boards, I think one thing that, um,

[1654.815 - 1657.535] I was reminded of that I have questions about is this is the

[1657.855 - 1660.255] earliest stage company I've ever been with.

[1660.595 - 1663.535] Um, I've been with, you know, much, I've been

[1663.535 - 1666.055] with public companies in earlier phases of my career

[1666.185 - 1671.015] where I have some corporate experience, um, with disclosures

[1671.015 - 1673.895] and filings as well as, you know, some exposure

[1673.895 - 1675.175] to the board, but not a ton

[1675.175 - 1677.095] because I was not the general counsel at that time.

[1677.275 - 1680.415] So I've never been the general counsel, um, dealing

[1680.415 - 1681.575] with a public company board.

[1682.115 - 1684.415] So, um, I guess one of the things I,

[1684.695 - 1688.295] I wonder about is in doing our latest round, um, I learned

[1688.565 - 1692.375] that the choice of the investors was related to,

[1693.355 - 1695.735] um, the current, uh, board

[1695.995 - 1699.535] and CEO's kind of thoughts on

[1699.635 - 1701.815] who might be best as a director.

[1702.555 - 1705.295] Um, we were oversubscribed as in many, um,

[1705.295 - 1706.575] digital health situations.

[1706.795 - 1710.575] And I think, um, as happens as commonly happens, you know,

[1710.575 - 1711.775] the choosing the choice

[1711.775 - 1715.815] of which investors can sometimes be connected to

[1716.845 - 1719.215] what their presence on the board might mean.

[1719.275 - 1722.095] And so I'm interested in hearing from both Fenwick

[1722.195 - 1724.015] and colleagues as to

[1724.125 - 1726.015] what their experience has been in that arena.

[1726.635 - 1729.775] As well as, um, managing the board from a general counsel

[1729.775 - 1733.495] perspective, particularly if you come in, um, at any time,

[1733.795 - 1735.415] say post series A

[1735.515 - 1738.375] and there have already been board, you know, directors there

[1738.435 - 1740.455] for a while, have a relationship with the CEO

[1740.455 - 1744.175] and what that means for the GC in terms of influence

[1744.245 - 1745.815] with the board and what kind

[1745.815 - 1747.535] of independent relationship one can have

[1747.535 - 1752.095] with the board when the, the CEO, you know, is, is in charge

[1752.315 - 1755.335] and, and has had a longer relationship with those directors.

[1755.435 - 1757.735] So interested in hearing a bit about that as well.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[1759.895 - 1761.275] Thanks, Sarah. And then Joanna,

[1761.275 - 1762.755] I think we have, we have you on our list.

**[Speaker 19.0]**


[1764.545 - 1769.245] Yes. Last but not least, Go next. Sorry.

**[Speaker 18.0]**


[1770.815 - 1774.755] I'm the, uh, um, uh, CLO

[1774.775 - 1776.395] and SVP of NEO Systems,

[1776.535 - 1779.755] and we provide back office, um, solutions

[1779.755 - 1784.285] for government contractors, um, hosting cybersecurity, um,

[1785.195 - 1788.405] managed cybersecurity accounting services, um,

[1788.455 - 1792.525] human capital management, um, and financial planning

[1792.545 - 1794.405] and analysis, um, uh, for,

[1794.465 - 1795.885] for not just government contractors,

[1795.885 - 1800.205] but highly regulated, um, industries such

[1800.205 - 1801.765] as nonprofits and so forth.

[1802.465 - 1807.085] Um, and the challenge we're currently facing is we were

[1807.085 - 1809.005] just, we are recently acquired by,

[1809.225 - 1810.765] um, a private equity firm.

[1811.145 - 1813.405] And so our whole board has been replaced

[1813.585 - 1814.725] except for the founders.

[1815.475 - 1816.485] They remain on,

[1816.505 - 1820.445] but we have the investors on the board, um, now as well.

[1820.665 - 1824.325] And so this is a very timely, uh,

[1825.725 - 1827.935] session, uh, for, for our company.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[1831.345 - 1832.995] Awesome. Thank you. And do we have,

[1832.995 - 1834.155] have we done introductions for everyone?

[1834.155 - 1835.155] Craig, did we get you?

**[Speaker 20.0]**


[1836.005 - 1838.785] No, you didn't. Sorry, I had to jump off. Uh, hi everyone.

[1838.785 - 1843.225] Craig Siegel. Uh, I am, uh, CLO at, uh, Hootsuite.

[1843.765 - 1845.305] Uh, I'm located in Toronto.

[1845.845 - 1849.665] Uh, Hootsuite is, uh, a social media management platform,

[1849.845 - 1853.385] so assists, uh, businesses with, uh, social marketing,

[1853.385 - 1856.745] social commerce, uh, 1200 employees.

[1857.165 - 1862.065] Um, our board is made up of, uh, essentially, uh, founder

[1862.565 - 1865.465] and, and, uh, investor, uh, nominees.

[1866.165 - 1868.985] Uh, we are looking at a, a bunch of different opportunities

[1869.255 - 1872.065] that, uh, could impact the, uh, the makeup of the board,

[1872.065 - 1875.105] essentially potentially looking to move to more

[1875.105 - 1876.265] of an independent board.

[1876.925 - 1878.225] Uh, about a year, year

[1878.225 - 1882.105] and a half ago, we moved from a founder, CEO, uh, who, uh,

[1882.945 - 1885.945] interest was, uh, not, uh, not that much into,

[1886.085 - 1887.425] uh, heavy governance.

[1887.445 - 1890.825] And we've moved into a, uh, essentially a professional CEO

[1890.825 - 1893.065] where governance is absolutely at the forefront.

[1893.085 - 1895.465] So it's a bit of a continuum in terms of, uh,

[1895.745 - 1897.985] strengthening our, uh, governance program.

[1898.285 - 1899.905] So, uh, looking forward to the conversation.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[1901.545 - 1904.315] Awesome. Well really appreciate everybody giving some

[1904.315 - 1905.795] context and background on where they are.

[1906.385 - 1907.755] I'll jump in with the first question,

[1907.855 - 1910.035] but folks, please plan to jump in and help me out

[1910.155 - 1911.475] 'cause no one wants to just hear my questions.

[1912.215 - 1913.915] Uh, one of the things that, that resonated

[1913.915 - 1915.315] with me in listening to everybody

[1915.455 - 1918.155] and their questions tonight is about the evolving role

[1918.155 - 1920.875] of a board of directors over the lifecycle of a company.

[1921.735 - 1922.995] If I think about my CEO,

[1923.015 - 1925.155] he talks about the board having a responsibility

[1925.175 - 1927.995] to deliver foresight, oversight, and insight.

[1928.655 - 1930.315] And, you know, different people can deliver

[1930.315 - 1931.715] different parts of that, perhaps.

[1932.345 - 1934.915] Certainly the role of the board changes when you're talking

[1934.915 - 1936.995] about an early stage startup company all

[1936.995 - 1938.075] the way through a public company.

[1938.135 - 1941.435] And so, Kat and Ellen, I'm curious as to how would you

[1941.995 - 1944.915] recommend folks like us think about the board and its role

[1944.975 - 1946.035] and how to interact

[1946.035 - 1947.635] with them most effectively based on those

[1947.635 - 1949.195] different stages of life?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[1952.825 - 1954.035] Yeah, I'll jump in.

[1954.155 - 1956.275] I mean, I, I think you start out as a,

[1956.475 - 1959.605] a newly formed company with a founder, two founders,

[1959.715 - 1961.245] they're on the board, and,

[1961.305 - 1964.005] and there's a first step which involves some level

[1964.025 - 1965.525] of giving up control, right?

[1965.545 - 1967.325] And that's a, that's a big moment.

[1967.385 - 1970.125] You take money from someone outside, um,

[1970.125 - 1971.365] your board immediately changes.

[1971.515 - 1972.965] It's not just your company anymore.

[1972.965 - 1975.085] You've gotta, um, even if it,

[1975.085 - 1976.805] even if they don't have control of the board,

[1977.635 - 1979.925] most things are done by consensus at that level.

[1979.985 - 1981.805] And you need to bring someone along with you,

[1981.865 - 1983.165] you need to report to them.

[1983.825 - 1986.165] So board meetings become professionalized.

[1986.465 - 1990.165] You're, um, you're preparing materials in advance,

[1990.425 - 1993.045] you're taking criticism and input.

[1993.385 - 1997.005] Um, I think some people alluded to the importance

[1997.025 - 1998.875] of who you recruit.

[1999.055 - 2001.235] And Julie, I liked your, your, um,

[2001.615 - 2003.995] I'm not sure I can repeat it, your foresight, oversight,

[2004.055 - 2005.435] and insight.

[2005.495 - 2008.875] Was it, um, that that's where I think foresight

[2008.875 - 2011.075] and insight are most important at that stage.

[2011.075 - 2015.075] Perhaps, um, you know, you a board member

[2015.825 - 2018.235] that is also an investor that can come in

[2018.235 - 2020.475] and has, has been there with other companies

[2020.535 - 2023.715] and can see, you know, what the, what the dials are

[2023.735 - 2025.955] for your company to help take it to the next level

[2026.015 - 2028.715] to prepare it for its next fundraising round to go

[2028.715 - 2032.355] to market, um, to, to penetrate customer bases

[2032.355 - 2033.435] that you haven't before.

[2034.255 - 2037.915] Um, I think the board at that stage is, is doing a lot more,

[2038.815 - 2042.515] um, senior experience, business advice

[2042.615 - 2046.275] and strategy advice than they are governance and oversight.

[2046.375 - 2048.475] You know, the governance and oversight happens from your,

[2049.345 - 2054.195] your, your contractual documents, your, um, the rules

[2054.415 - 2056.835] and, and the fact that there's no more money coming if,

[2056.975 - 2058.955] if you don't do, do your job right

[2058.975 - 2060.675] and please your investors along the way.

[2061.495 - 2065.915] Um, oftentimes at that stage, a board will have a, a,

[2066.015 - 2068.555] an empty seat for an independent director.

[2068.655 - 2070.875] You know, I often see this kind of board of five,

[2071.535 - 2074.715] two founders, two um, two investors,

[2075.015 - 2076.955] and a fifth player to be named later

[2076.975 - 2078.675] that's gonna be an independent director.

[2079.255 - 2082.315] You know, I think that that independent director can be

[2082.315 - 2085.675] worth their weight in gold if they are really a contributor.

[2085.895 - 2090.115] So, um, companies often wait a long time to find them.

[2090.175 - 2092.955] You gotta pay them usually, um, if you want 'em

[2092.955 - 2094.075] to, to do good work.

[2094.775 - 2096.195] Um, if you move too quickly

[2096.295 - 2099.115] and get the wrong person, I think you can, you can pay

[2099.115 - 2101.195] for something that doesn't add value or worse.

[2101.455 - 2104.795] You can, you can, you can pay for a director that really is,

[2105.055 - 2107.075] you know, closely tied to your investors

[2107.175 - 2108.795] and isn't truly independent.

[2109.535 - 2113.755] Um, but when you find that, um, industry expert, um,

[2114.145 - 2115.795] that is truly independent from you

[2116.695 - 2120.715] and independent from your investors, um, the value

[2120.715 - 2125.235] that they bring when there's a real problem, um, is,

[2125.455 - 2127.115] is immense, right?

[2127.315 - 2130.635] I mean, um, when things are going well up into the right,

[2131.505 - 2132.835] what the board votes are,

[2132.905 - 2135.075] doesn't matter when there's conflict

[2135.455 - 2136.875] and there's disagreement

[2137.105 - 2140.165] or there's gonna be recapitalizations, restructurings,

[2140.875 - 2143.445] layoffs, whatever it might be, executive changes.

[2144.025 - 2149.005] Um, having a steady hand that is independent from purely

[2149.525 - 2151.565] investor financial incentives and purely management

[2152.005 - 2154.805] compensation incentives, but can help you think through that

[2154.825 - 2157.165] and lead through it is, is really valuable.

[2158.105 - 2161.125] Um, so I think searching for, for someone at that stage

[2161.145 - 2164.405] to fill that role, um, can be important.

[2165.035 - 2166.965] Your board will only grow from there.

[2167.105 - 2169.605] So I heard a couple of you talk about, you know, how do I,

[2170.385 - 2171.875] how do I get rid of board members?

[2172.255 - 2173.555] Um, it's hard, right?

[2173.735 - 2177.075] So I do think caution as you grow your board is important.

[2177.355 - 2179.275] 'cause it's kind of a one way ratchet in a way.

[2179.615 - 2181.075] Um, you know,

[2181.075 - 2184.635] there comes a time often when those two founder seats are

[2184.635 - 2187.155] too many and the boardroom's getting crowded,

[2187.255 - 2189.515] and maybe that second founder is,

[2189.775 - 2191.115] you know, is likely is not.

[2191.115 - 2194.675] The CEO is a, an exec that reports to the CEO

[2194.695 - 2198.035] and it may be less appropriate at some stage for that person

[2198.135 - 2200.035] to be in all of the board discussions.

[2200.935 - 2203.555] Um, and, you know, there comes a time when

[2204.105 - 2207.195] that discussion needs to happen of we're gonna go to a,

[2207.715 - 2211.795] a board with one, you know, common seat, one founder seed.

[2211.935 - 2214.355] And you know, that's where two partners

[2214.355 - 2217.795] that have gone into business together, um, and

[2217.815 - 2219.715] or, you know, that independent director

[2219.715 - 2221.555] that I talked about in the previous chapter

[2221.705 - 2223.955] that you've recruited can have that conversation

[2223.955 - 2226.035] with the person about stepping back

[2226.175 - 2230.315] and being able to focus on, um, the management.

[2230.495 - 2233.035] And oftentimes it's a CTO or something.

[2233.035 - 2237.955] So product delivery, um, uh, kind of, um, skill sets

[2237.975 - 2239.475] and time devotion that they need.

[2240.335 - 2244.755] Um, and then you start to, to attach observers

[2244.975 - 2248.155] and additional investors and your board grows.

[2248.335 - 2252.675] And, um, I, I see companies make the mistake

[2252.975 - 2257.155] of being too generous with either observation rights

[2257.155 - 2259.715] that are contractual or worse with just inviting people

[2259.715 - 2261.475] to the board meeting that don't have observation

[2261.475 - 2262.675] rights as if it's theater.

[2263.335 - 2265.875] Um, I think you're doing it wrong if you're treating your

[2265.875 - 2268.275] board meeting as theater, uh, whether for the rest

[2268.275 - 2269.315] of your management team

[2269.455 - 2273.675] or for, you know, um, others that come along

[2273.675 - 2276.595] with your investors, um, you know, for the board

[2276.595 - 2279.435] to have an effective discussion for them to disagree

[2279.435 - 2283.035] with one another, um, to disagree with management

[2283.035 - 2286.555] and provide feedback, um, you not, not conflict,

[2286.655 - 2287.915] I'm not saying that in a negative way,

[2287.975 - 2289.475] but to have a healthy exchange

[2289.575 - 2291.875] and a dialogue that hopefully leads to a better answer.

[2292.475 - 2294.675] I think a more intimate environment is important.

[2294.775 - 2297.555] And so I would be very cautious about

[2297.825 - 2299.315] expanding the boardroom too much.

[2299.415 - 2301.355] It happens, you know, people don't wanna have

[2301.355 - 2305.475] that conversation and there can be a cultural impact

[2305.495 - 2308.155] of who's getting disinvited from the board meetings.

[2308.215 - 2310.035] That's real. Um,

[2310.295 - 2312.035] but I, you know, I do think, I, I forget

[2312.035 - 2313.315] who, who commented early.

[2313.805 - 2315.31] Maybe you just need to go have the

[2315.31 - 2316.445] direct conversation, Renee.

[2317.035 - 2321.665] Yeah, I think you do. Um, I think the best way to, to do

[2321.665 - 2326.065] that though is to start to have a dialogue about what the,

[2326.205 - 2327.705] the goals of the institution

[2327.705 - 2329.465] and the board meeting are first, um,

[2330.595 - 2332.845] make sure people have a common understanding of that.

[2333.745 - 2336.565] And that provides context for, you know,

[2336.565 - 2339.045] that next discussion about, you know, we,

[2339.185 - 2342.125] we we're gonna reduce this so that it's, um,

[2342.875 - 2345.485] it's not a fishbowl, it's a dialogue.

[2345.665 - 2347.805] And and it's not just you by the way.

[2347.875 - 2349.845] It's, you know, for other people

[2349.915 - 2352.565] that are gonna not be invited to the next meeting,

[2353.255 - 2355.045] maybe it's a little easier these days than Zoom.

[2355.045 - 2356.365] Maybe that's one of the advantages.

[2356.365 - 2358.645] You can just not provide the Zoom code to certain people.

[2358.845 - 2361.445] I don't know. Um, it's a little harder if they just can

[2361.445 - 2363.045] stumble into the boardroom, I guess.

[2364.065 - 2365.925] Um, but if they don't know when it is

[2365.925 - 2368.045] or what the meeting code is that maybe you don't have

[2368.045 - 2369.325] to have that direct conversation.

[2370.165 - 2373.445] I still think it's a good idea. Um, and then

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[2373.745 - 2376.285] One, one funny tidbit around that one, just for

[2376.875 - 2379.685] Zoom Entertainment was that we had a a,

[2379.925 - 2380.965] a science update meeting

[2380.985 - 2382.965] before our board meeting last summer.

[2383.145 - 2384.205] We had a bunch of observers.

[2384.205 - 2387.005] It was pre IPO, and the big request we got was,

[2387.065 - 2388.805] can you record it and send it to us?

[2389.835 - 2391.925] Yeah, sure. We're gonna give an update on all

[2391.925 - 2393.445] of our key science and progress.

[2393.575 - 2395.725] We'll just record that and send it to you. Yeah.

[2395.905 - 2397.605] And it's just a great example of,

[2397.665 - 2400.645] of people not really thinking through why

[2400.645 - 2401.725] that would be a bad idea.

[2401.785 - 2403.365] And my chairman was like, oh, wait, we can do that.

[2403.365 - 2405.325] And I was like, no, this isn't a, it's not a show,

[2405.385 - 2407.965] to your point, this is not a movie, right?

[2407.985 - 2410.245] We need to be really smart about the information flow.

[2410.245 - 2412.085] And I think that's part of the process, right?

[2412.345 - 2414.045] You start in these early stage companies

[2414.045 - 2416.285] and everyone's kind of clubby decisions get made

[2416.285 - 2417.445] kind of by consensus.

[2417.595 - 2419.325] Paperwork is kind of secondary.

[2419.745 - 2421.605] Record keeping is kind of sloppy.

[2422.105 - 2424.405] And then all of a sudden you are on this line

[2424.405 - 2427.725] of sight down the road eventually to either an acquisition

[2427.825 - 2431.005] or an IPO, and you've gotta start to professionalize.

[2431.145 - 2433.205] And, and I think that's part of what a lot

[2433.205 - 2434.765] of the folks in this group work on.

[2434.825 - 2436.605] How do you get in front of the board

[2437.265 - 2441.605] and put yourself in a position to just be a facilitator of

[2442.345 - 2444.685] not just good decision making, but good process.

[2445.545 - 2446.565] And I think that's what a lot

[2446.565 - 2447.965] of us are thinking about in our jobs.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[2449.455 - 2451.765] Sarah, I see your comment to Chad. That was a joke.

[2451.945 - 2453.125] I'm sorry. Yes, I agree.

[2453.225 - 2455.005] Not just pro, just not providing the Zoom

**[Speaker 19.0]**


[2455.295 - 2456.295] Links not the right answer. Sorry.

[2456.295 - 2457.125] I'm sorry about that.

[2457.365 - 2459.285] I did have to step away to help with dinner

[2459.385 - 2460.725] and I like wasn't watching you.

[2460.745 - 2463.845] So I may have not on the context, but yes, I agree.

[2463.845 - 2465.925] Getting them off is very difficult. Yeah.

[2465.925 - 2466.965] Or getting them off calls.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[2469.685 - 2470.935] Yeah, I think that's right, Julie.

[2471.175 - 2474.215] I think, um, you know, the who,

[2474.265 - 2475.815] who's on your board matters here.

[2476.035 - 2478.255] And for, for you as general counsels,

[2478.875 - 2483.565] if you can find an ally on the board to that end, I,

[2483.685 - 2485.845] I think that's immensely valuable to you.

[2485.985 - 2489.405] So if there's a, you know, a chairman, chair, chair person,

[2490.225 - 2491.965] um, that is senior and seasoned

[2491.965 - 2494.205] and cares about these things, that's great, right?

[2494.265 - 2496.405] You can go to them, you can talk to them about

[2497.025 - 2499.205] how do we work together to, to do this.

[2499.425 - 2502.965] If you're fighting, you know, a board that wants to cut

[2502.965 - 2505.325] to the chase and doesn't wanna work on these things

[2505.545 - 2507.245] and, you know, maybe A-A-C-E-O

[2507.245 - 2509.405] or a management team that isn't as focused on it,

[2509.835 - 2511.565] that can be a hard road to hoe.

[2511.905 - 2514.565] Um, and, and then I think you gotta spend a lot more time

[2515.305 - 2516.805] trying to demonstrate the value

[2516.825 - 2518.085] of it and the importance of it.

[2518.225 - 2521.085] And, you know, I, I find it hard.

[2521.245 - 2522.725] I know you all find it hard

[2522.725 - 2524.845] because I think a lot of the times you've got to,

[2524.845 - 2526.365] you've gotta go to sort of horror stories.

[2526.425 - 2529.245] And this is what happens when things go badly

[2529.345 - 2530.725] and don't let this be you.

[2530.905 - 2534.445] And, you know, I never like to have to persuade that way

[2534.445 - 2537.285] because I think it's easy for people to, you know,

[2537.525 - 2538.525] distance themselves from that

[2538.525 - 2539.885] and believe it's not gonna be them.

[2540.505 - 2542.365] But, you know, I've seen the movie,

[2542.555 - 2543.885] I've seen how it ends that way.

[2544.505 - 2547.485] It ends that way for many companies.

[2547.905 - 2551.005] Um, you know, and one way or another turning negative.

[2551.025 - 2553.245] And, and you want to have had the right governance along the

[2553.245 - 2554.965] way to, before you get to that point.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[2559.035 - 2560.255] So one of the other questions

[2560.255 - 2563.015] that we got at the outset was sort of around how

[2563.015 - 2564.855] to manage getting somebody off the board.

[2564.855 - 2565.895] And, and I know Alan and Kat,

[2565.895 - 2567.575] you've guys got some war stories around this.

[2568.235 - 2570.735] Um, before I, I direct you guys

[2570.775 - 2571.895] to sort of jump into the topic.

[2572.115 - 2574.055] One thing I'll, I'll share just for again,

[2574.055 - 2576.655] entertainment value, you know, we had a director at one

[2576.655 - 2580.895] of my prior employee employers who, um, was known to show up

[2580.895 - 2582.655] and then promptly fall asleep at the meeting,

[2583.275 - 2584.535] had been an employee of the company

[2584.635 - 2588.495] and a prior executive was on as our chairman, um,

[2588.495 - 2591.175] but often was the least useful person in the room.

[2591.755 - 2594.335] And sort of no way to move that person out with any,

[2594.555 - 2596.375] you know, ease, especially in the context

[2596.475 - 2598.055] of it being a public company where,

[2598.195 - 2599.415] you know, that would be very visible.

[2599.955 - 2601.895] And so I'm curious as to how you think about, right,

[2601.895 - 2603.295] if you're in the private company stage

[2603.295 - 2605.335] and you're going for a next round of financing,

[2605.795 - 2608.215] that's often an inflection point where you can sort

[2608.215 - 2609.775] of group together with some directors

[2609.775 - 2611.695] and talk about who should stay and who should go.

[2612.155 - 2614.255] But are there other strategies that you would recommend

[2614.395 - 2615.815] for thinking through and, and,

[2615.915 - 2617.815] and how do you see the GCs role in that?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[2619.465 - 2621.075] Yeah, I, you know, I've seen it, um,

[2622.105 - 2624.075] I've seen it go poorly and I've seen it go well.

[2624.355 - 2626.795] I think to your, uh, illusion, Julie,

[2626.995 - 2628.315] about the private company context.

[2629.565 - 2632.585] One of the harder situations is when it's a VC from a prior

[2632.585 - 2635.505] round that has a contractual right to that board seat.

[2635.565 - 2638.385] And you've, you've not only gotta ask the the person

[2638.645 - 2640.665] to step down, um,

[2640.845 - 2643.785] but you've gotta ask the VC to, to give up their right.

[2644.075 - 2647.385] There is a middle ground there that I see sort of work,

[2647.395 - 2650.545] which is to allow them to keep their contractual right

[2650.805 - 2653.385] and appoint, you know, an independent

[2653.385 - 2654.945] to their seat that you agree on.

[2655.465 - 2656.625] I don't love that solution.

[2656.825 - 2659.945] 'cause I think it, it compromises that incoming director's

[2660.575 - 2664.585] ability to truly feel independent if they are, you know,

[2664.685 - 2668.665] at the, at the behest of contractually, at the behest of a,

[2668.725 - 2670.665] of a particular investor.

[2671.465 - 2673.325] Um, even if that investor is saying,

[2673.385 - 2674.685] I'm not gonna exercise that, right?

[2674.745 - 2676.405] But that can be a bridge too, right?

[2676.405 - 2679.685] That can be a way to allow the VC to save face

[2679.755 - 2681.805] with their peers and not having to

[2682.595 - 2685.085] give up their rights while getting the person

[2685.085 - 2686.125] that you want in the door.

[2686.225 - 2689.205] And, you know, maybe nine months down the road that changes.

[2690.225 - 2693.045] Um, I do think that there's a, you know, a hard conversation

[2693.045 - 2694.165] that has to be had there.

[2694.265 - 2697.285] And usually it's the CEO that's, that's having it.

[2697.505 - 2700.205] Um, it's another situation where I think having

[2700.825 - 2705.245] an ally on the board, you know, um, can, can be valuable

[2705.245 - 2708.085] because it, it's personal and,

[2708.305 - 2711.685] and at one level you're telling, um, that director

[2711.685 - 2713.445] that you want off for whatever reason,

[2713.515 - 2715.325] that you don't find their contributions

[2715.385 - 2716.565] as valuable as the others.

[2716.705 - 2719.245] And that may be who their fund is

[2719.305 - 2720.565] and what connections they have.

[2720.565 - 2722.045] That may be their actual level

[2722.065 - 2723.725] of participation and engagement.

[2724.425 - 2727.445] Um, you know, I guess it's easier if they are

[2728.295 - 2731.555] openly disengaged or not attending or those sorts of things,

[2731.735 - 2733.915] but it's often more subtle than that.

[2734.655 - 2737.235] And so, you know, the, the worst situations I've seen

[2737.665 - 2740.635] that discussion led to a, you know, a conflict

[2740.635 - 2742.595] between the CEO and the director asked to leave

[2742.625 - 2745.435] that spilled out into, you know, the boardroom

[2745.615 - 2747.795] and was a public conflict and,

[2747.855 - 2751.615] and people were left feeling, uh, feeling badly about it.

[2751.635 - 2752.855] At the end of the day. I,

[2753.095 - 2757.015] I think the best situations I've seen, actually,

[2757.165 - 2758.535] it's a public company context,

[2758.675 - 2762.015] but I'm not sure it doesn't translate, were situations where

[2762.865 - 2766.735] there was a chair who himself ultimately needed to

[2767.325 - 2769.375] step aside in favor of new blood

[2769.635 - 2774.255] and, uh, open the dialogue, you know, a quarter in advance

[2774.525 - 2776.855] with the board about what the objectives are

[2776.955 - 2780.015] and how, you know, we've got a board that is here

[2780.195 - 2782.375] and we want to get it to here for these reasons.

[2782.375 - 2785.975] Whether it's diversity, bringing in more independence, um,

[2786.375 - 2788.855] bringing in more audit committee expertise,

[2789.295 - 2792.255] bringing in more operational skill sets to mentor the CEO.

[2792.955 - 2796.015] Um, we need to achieve all those objectives.

[2796.715 - 2798.695] And, you know, that's gonna involve some

[2798.695 - 2800.335] transitioning of board members.

[2800.575 - 2803.735] I, I'd like to hear from each of you what your, you know,

[2803.735 - 2806.255] continued interest level is in participating,

[2806.275 - 2808.815] but I'm gonna be talking to you about that dialogue

[2808.815 - 2810.615] and how we, how we order it.

[2810.635 - 2812.975] And I, I think trying to get people focused on

[2814.255 - 2816.795] why you're doing this in a way that is not personal to them

[2816.935 - 2818.595] and what, why it's good for the company

[2819.415 - 2822.075] is good table setting and just framing it

[2822.215 - 2825.675] and then building a plan where the succession that needs

[2825.675 - 2827.195] to happen is staged over time.

[2827.375 - 2831.435] So, you know, maybe one seed is surrendered every year,

[2831.535 - 2832.915] and that's known in advance.

[2832.975 - 2836.475] You know, we're gonna move out our series A director next

[2836.585 - 2839.755] year, and we're gonna replace them with, um,

[2840.815 - 2842.555] an independent diverse board member.

[2842.735 - 2845.395] And then in the second year, as we're a year away from IPO,

[2845.395 - 2847.155] we're gonna move out our series B board member

[2847.175 - 2849.075] and we're gonna replace 'em with an audit committee chair.

[2849.825 - 2853.485] Um, I think also having a plan, um,

[2854.825 - 2858.045] you know, can, can let the other directors participate in

[2858.045 - 2860.045] the plan, and it doesn't feel like that first person

[2860.075 - 2862.925] that got tapped is the one that's getting picked on.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[2864.805 - 2867.095] Yeah, I would, I would just reiterate that the, um,

[2867.435 - 2870.895] for a lot of you, you are later stage private companies

[2871.115 - 2874.655] and, uh, the preparation for going public needs

[2874.655 - 2876.855] to happen far earlier than an org meeting.

[2877.395 - 2881.175] Um, getting, getting a public company ready board needs

[2881.175 - 2883.775] to happen, you know, at least sometimes like 18 months,

[2883.835 - 2885.735] two years before you're gonna go out.

[2886.315 - 2887.735] Um, in particular, just

[2887.735 - 2891.055] because these days it's not just finding an audit committee

[2891.055 - 2892.935] financial expert and finding folks

[2892.955 - 2894.415] who can read financial statements.

[2894.955 - 2896.895] Um, if any of you have companies

[2896.895 - 2899.975] that are headquartered in California, you have to comply

[2900.085 - 2903.615] with the, you know, the California laws, uh, with respect

[2903.615 - 2906.215] to having, you know, women being on your board

[2906.215 - 2908.455] and underrepresented minorities on your board.

[2909.115 - 2912.255] Um, and for anyone who is planning to list on nasdaq,

[2912.355 - 2914.335] NASDAQ just came out with their rules, right?

[2914.435 - 2917.655] So your board, uh, within a year of listing would have

[2917.655 - 2919.415] to have a, a woman and an underrepresented

[2919.655 - 2920.935] minority, uh, on the board.

[2921.635 - 2925.855] And so also with the increased focus from like ISS,

[2925.855 - 2929.615] glass Lewis and every single major fund from Fidelity

[2929.835 - 2932.295] to State Street, to, you know, BlackRock,

[2932.325 - 2934.255] they all have governance guidelines now

[2934.315 - 2937.415] and, uh, diversity, uh, and, and,

[2937.435 - 2938.855] and focus on, you know,

[2938.855 - 2941.375] having effective boards is really, really important.

[2941.835 - 2944.295] So I think to Alan's point, like coming up

[2944.295 - 2947.215] with a strategy far earlier than actually being public about

[2947.985 - 2950.355] what is my board, you know, here to do

[2950.655 - 2953.155] and actually putting together like a rubric for

[2953.155 - 2955.675] what I want out of it, and, you know, coming up

[2955.675 - 2957.555] with actual competency matrices

[2957.575 - 2960.075] and who's checking kind of, uh, you know, what boxes,

[2960.135 - 2963.115] and it's not just from a, you know, this is a,

[2963.195 - 2964.755] a diverse candidate, but you know, someone

[2964.755 - 2966.355] who has operational background, someone

[2966.375 - 2969.235] who has experience scaling my particular type of business,

[2969.735 - 2973.315] um, you know, someone who has experience on doing, you know,

[2973.465 - 2975.435] extensive m and a, if that's a big part of your,

[2975.435 - 2978.315] your strategy, um, making sure that you're kind

[2978.315 - 2980.835] of filling those gaps and to Alan's point, planning

[2981.015 - 2982.075] how you're gonna fill those

[2982.415 - 2985.635] and starting a conversation early with, uh, you know,

[2985.635 - 2987.315] with your existing board members about

[2987.815 - 2990.915] how we're gonna reach those goals and transition to it.

[2990.915 - 2993.675] So it's a smooth glide into becoming a public company

[2994.215 - 2996.675] as opposed to this being like a slap dash rush, right?

[2996.675 - 3000.515] Like at an org meeting where you're frantically competing

[3000.515 - 3003.075] for candidates because, um, as I'm sure many

[3003.075 - 3006.515] of you are aware right now that the market for finding, um,

[3006.585 - 3009.755] independent board members, let alone people who can, uh,

[3009.755 - 3011.195] you know, folks who are women, folks

[3011.195 - 3013.475] who are underrepresented minorities, it is, it's very,

[3013.475 - 3014.635] very competitive right now.

[3015.375 - 3018.235] Um, and if you have to also be filling audit, you know,

[3018.825 - 3021.035] just audit competency, it's just, it's,

[3021.105 - 3022.955] it's a very competitive market.

[3023.575 - 3026.995] So starting the dialogue a lot earlier than you'd think

[3027.505 - 3032.165] can be actually a mechanism for you to help maneuver, uh,

[3032.885 - 3034.405] maneuver your board in the direction

[3034.405 - 3037.765] of going more independent, um, uh,

[3037.785 - 3039.005] you know, for the, for the long term.

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[3039.865 - 3041.565] Can I, can I push on that one for a second?

[3041.805 - 3044.085] I think that probably depends on what, um,

[3045.665 - 3047.675] what your vertical is, what your market is.

[3047.915 - 3050.155] I think you, you raised some really good points.

[3050.235 - 3051.915] I mean, we're going public very shortly.

[3052.135 - 3055.035] We have a board that is, uh, five

[3055.055 - 3057.795] of the nine are not white men, I put it that way.

[3057.795 - 3059.195] Mm-hmm. That way. Um,

[3059.575 - 3061.515] and it hits all our diversity requirements

[3061.935 - 3064.795] and then maybe harder for some, I think in other industries,

[3064.975 - 3066.915] if you're not an e-commerce in

[3066.915 - 3067.995] e-commerce, I think that's easier.

[3069.215 - 3070.955] The reality is like, I went

[3070.955 - 3073.035] through this a TripAdvisor a long time ago too

[3073.535 - 3074.635] before vivid seats

[3074.695 - 3078.035] and like, you're just trying to get through day-to-day

[3078.035 - 3079.235] and build your business, right?

[3079.235 - 3081.675] Like the reality is two years ahead of time.

[3081.785 - 3083.395] Like that's in your mind, right?

[3083.395 - 3085.075] That's your things you're talking about

[3085.095 - 3086.155] if you're there at the time.

[3086.215 - 3087.955] But a lot of us are stepping into the role

[3088.485 - 3090.675] maybe less than two years before you're going public.

[3091.335 - 3095.275] So there is some, you know, there's a lot of that,

[3095.275 - 3096.355] panic is not the right word.

[3096.505 - 3098.515] There's a lot of stuff you have to do very quickly.

[3098.835 - 3100.315] I think this is sort of one of them,

[3100.375 - 3102.195] and obviously you wanna be thinking about advance,

[3102.255 - 3103.395] but I would push on the fact that

[3103.395 - 3104.515] you need two years for that.

[3104.595 - 3106.035] I don't think that's necessarily,

[3106.355 - 3107.435] I think it's great if you can,

[3107.695 - 3108.795] but I think the reality of

[3108.795 - 3110.435] where we live in is you probably aren't

[3110.435 - 3111.515] gonna get that for some of us.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[3112.225 - 3114.275] Yeah. And Dan, I think some of us are gonna inherit

[3114.275 - 3115.515] that situation and hope our

[3115.515 - 3117.755] outside council's been helping them manage through some of

[3117.755 - 3118.875] that on the, on the front end,

[3118.875 - 3119.915] because you're right, we,

[3119.975 - 3122.315] we often don't get there until later.

[3123.235 - 3125.275] I do think that having gone through two,

[3125.335 - 3127.835] my last two companies went public with me joining sort

[3127.835 - 3130.075] of midstream in one and just prior for the other.

[3130.775 - 3134.395] And I can certainly tell you that the board's sense of,

[3134.395 - 3136.635] you know, the urgency around this was not as high

[3136.635 - 3137.795] as it probably ought to have been,

[3137.795 - 3139.315] at least in one of those two companies.

[3140.015 - 3141.755] And you're then playing catch up, right?

[3141.755 - 3142.875] You're, you're sort of being like, well,

[3142.875 - 3144.795] we'll get questionnaires and we'll see who qualifies.

[3144.795 - 3146.155] Like that's not a great place to be.

[3146.855 - 3148.835] So it, it's definitely a challenge.

[3149.075 - 3152.035] I do think that Kat's point though about the competition is

[3152.035 - 3153.835] exceedingly important, right?

[3153.935 - 3156.035] You know, I don't know how many folks in this group have

[3156.065 - 3158.795] some form of a board search, either active

[3158.935 - 3161.275] or thinking about it or sort of socializing it,

[3161.295 - 3163.955] but finding the right fit people

[3164.375 - 3165.955] for these roles is really hard.

[3165.975 - 3168.435] And if you also are trying to check the boxes on some

[3168.435 - 3170.035] of these important diversity rules,

[3170.445 - 3173.075] which are becoming effective for most of us in the next year

[3173.075 - 3175.195] or two, it's gonna be really challenging.

[3175.375 - 3177.835] And, and I think it's great that we're pushing companies

[3177.835 - 3178.875] to move in this direction,

[3179.255 - 3180.995] but we're all competing for the same talent.

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[3181.935 - 3185.745] Yeah. I, I would just jump, uh, I was gonna just

[3187.805 - 3189.265] So along, along the same lines of

[3189.265 - 3191.185] what other people are saying, I think, I think it's great

[3191.185 - 3192.865] to do it as far advance as you can.

[3193.325 - 3194.625] My company, we're probably there,

[3194.625 - 3195.985] we're starting to think about this.

[3196.535 - 3201.445] What I found, what I'm finding is that, you know,

[3201.755 - 3204.205] Alan, you said maybe getting a someone who has a,

[3204.285 - 3206.085] a contractual right off the board.

[3206.315 - 3208.085] I've found that to be not just at this company,

[3208.105 - 3210.925] but other companies, very hard for them to say, okay,

[3211.025 - 3212.645] I'm gonna give up my contractual, right.

[3213.025 - 3215.165] You don't really know when a company's gonna go public.

[3215.165 - 3216.645] Even if they think they're gonna go public,

[3216.645 - 3217.925] you don't know when COVID is gonna hit

[3217.925 - 3218.965] or something else is gonna hit.

[3219.465 - 3223.795] And, um, I found them, you know, not,

[3224.135 - 3226.355] not very open to that until they know

[3226.425 - 3228.355] that you're going public.

[3228.935 - 3231.315] Uh, and similarly you're talking about all the talent.

[3231.555 - 3235.235] I mean the, the, the competition for, uh, the talent,

[3235.295 - 3238.995] the IPO talent, the, the directors, they have a lot

[3238.995 - 3240.355] of other opportunities out there,

[3240.655 - 3244.645] and I'm not, I don't know that they're interested two years

[3244.645 - 3246.325] before maybe some companies,

[3246.325 - 3248.045] maybe there's a few companies they'd be interested in going

[3248.065 - 3250.725] to two years ahead of time in anticipation

[3250.725 - 3252.725] of it being, you know, being public.

[3252.785 - 3255.485] But there's only so many boards that they can really be on.

[3255.665 - 3257.885] So I think they're pretty particular

[3258.025 - 3261.845] and they, they wanna know a lot of them anyway, wanna know

[3261.845 - 3263.925] that this is more of a sure thing before they're,

[3264.265 - 3266.565] before they're, uh, committing to me.

[3266.565 - 3269.895] What seems to be the best thing to try to do is

[3269.895 - 3271.775] to start building those relationships, have,

[3271.775 - 3273.055] have the conversations, like you said,

[3273.055 - 3274.455] have conversations with the directors.

[3274.455 - 3275.815] This is what we want our board to look like,

[3276.085 - 3278.175] have conversations, start having conversations

[3278.175 - 3279.775] with potential board members

[3279.795 - 3282.135] and saying, look, if we're getting closer, you know,

[3282.165 - 3283.575] we'd really be interested in you.

[3284.115 - 3286.885] And then I don't know if you have to wait till,

[3286.915 - 3289.645] till you have your IPO kickoff meeting,

[3289.785 - 3293.085] but sometimes sooner than that, sometime closer to that,

[3293.665 - 3296.645] you know, nine months out when you're potentially even

[3296.645 - 3298.525] hiring your public company, CFO when

[3298.525 - 3299.885] you're, you know, those types of things.

[3299.985 - 3301.205] Now it's really getting into going,

[3301.365 - 3302.485] I think is is an easier time

[3302.485 - 3305.045] to make those transitions. That's my thoughts.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[3305.805 - 3307.535] Yeah, I think that's all true, Diane.

[3307.655 - 3309.735] I think a lot, a lot in a lot of cases it depends, right?

[3309.735 - 3311.815] There's sort of two themes going on

[3311.815 - 3312.855] in the world as I see it.

[3312.855 - 3314.135] There's one that's been there a little longer,

[3314.145 - 3316.135] which is companies we're taking longer

[3316.195 - 3318.335] and longer to go public and they were raising more

[3318.335 - 3319.735] and more money as private companies.

[3319.735 - 3323.015] And so you have these, you know, uh, unicorns, right?

[3323.125 - 3327.055] That, um, are raising larger and larger rounds on bigger

[3327.055 - 3330.055] and bigger valuations and adding more VCs to the mix.

[3330.565 - 3334.055] They can't just keep accumulating, you know, board members

[3334.145 - 3336.095] until they're 14 or 15, right?

[3336.395 - 3339.255] In that context, when you're asking your early stage

[3339.255 - 3342.575] investors that, you know, their strategy is not to keep up

[3342.645 - 3345.655] with growth stage investors, they don't have the,

[3345.655 - 3348.535] the balance sheets to, to do their pro rata share

[3348.535 - 3351.295] of those deals, you start to have it made more sense

[3351.355 - 3354.455] and be easier to, you know, replace an early one

[3354.455 - 3355.655] with a later one maybe.

[3355.755 - 3358.655] So that's, that may be a, a, a situation

[3358.655 - 3360.535] where you would find the contractual

[3360.605 - 3361.655] give up a little easier.

[3362.315 - 3365.095] The the other wave though is the SPAC wave, you know,

[3365.155 - 3366.935] and we have companies going public

[3367.605 - 3369.415] much earlier than they used to before.

[3369.415 - 3372.495] They've spent a long time planning, preparing,

[3372.825 - 3376.855] developing all the infrastructure, you know, working on,

[3377.275 - 3379.935] you know, um, SOX compliance.

[3380.235 - 3383.885] And I, I think it's gonna be interesting to see, um,

[3384.225 - 3385.725] you know, how that all turns out.

[3385.865 - 3387.925] Uh, it is gonna be a bit of an experiment

[3387.925 - 3390.645] and there are companies that have a very high level

[3390.645 - 3392.245] of sophistication and development

[3392.245 - 3393.325] at the time that they do it.

[3393.425 - 3395.405] And I, I trust that's all of you

[3395.405 - 3396.685] that are doing your SPACs right now.

[3396.855 - 3399.085] There are some that I've seen that it's, it's less so,

[3399.145 - 3401.325] and it's gonna be a bigger leap

[3401.325 - 3402.845] of faith for them to get there.

[3403.025 - 3406.045] And, and they, they wind up with a very short period

[3406.065 - 3409.085] of time in order to build all the infrastructure

[3409.115 - 3410.725] that you need to be a public company.

[3411.085 - 3413.405] I, I think where you don't want to be is

[3413.405 - 3414.485] to find yourself public

[3415.385 - 3417.525] and only focused on building your business.

[3417.675 - 3419.005] When you're in a fishbowl.

[3419.425 - 3421.645] The, the regulators, the investors,

[3421.835 - 3425.045] institutional investors are looking at you,

[3425.425 - 3426.645] uh, as a public company.

[3426.835 - 3429.805] They, they aren't gonna discern the fact that, um,

[3430.105 - 3432.165] you didn't have as much time to get ready as others

[3432.265 - 3433.365] and or aren't gonna care.

[3434.025 - 3436.565] Um, so you gotta catch up if you

[3436.565 - 3437.605] know if that's where you're gonna be.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[3440.385 - 3444.125] Hey, Alan and Kat, I have one question. Kat.

[3444.125 - 3447.685] You mentioned, you know, these, uh, board qualification

[3447.685 - 3451.045] and competency reviews, you know, qualification tables

[3451.045 - 3453.005] that public companies put out in proxies.

[3454.465 - 3457.795] Um, here's sort of looking

[3457.815 - 3460.155] for some practical guidance from anybody in this group.

[3461.065 - 3463.445] You send out, you know, a competency matrix,

[3464.045 - 3465.285] qualification matrix to the board,

[3465.865 - 3470.015] and people will sort of cross out as their competencies,

[3470.035 - 3473.495] all sorts of boxes, right? Um,

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[3473.885 - 3476.095] They'll say they're excellent at everything except at

[3476.295 - 3477.655] anything that gets 'em stuck on the audit committee.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[3478.695 - 3480.255] Oh, there you, there you go. Right?

[3480.725 - 3483.575] Look, someone who's doing middle market deals is not gonna

[3483.575 - 3486.375] be the right person for somebody who's

[3487.255 - 3489.735] a public company looking for transformational deals, right?

[3490.325 - 3494.055] Someone who has done a lot of,

[3494.355 - 3497.735] and you all should not take anything about our board

[3497.735 - 3499.495] as a result of this, this, these comments,

[3499.635 - 3500.895] but just think about it, right?

[3501.245 - 3504.015] Someone who's dealt with construction industry, all of his

[3504.015 - 3506.935] or her life is not going to be the person who's going

[3506.935 - 3509.805] to be able to say, yeah, pay

[3511.045 - 3513.025] 10 times the revenue of this tech company

[3513.025 - 3516.855] because here's why it makes sense or doesn't, right?

[3518.395 - 3522.015] Any thoughts, practical pointers on how you interact with

[3522.585 - 3525.545] those kinds of situations?

[3525.965 - 3528.665] In my mind, right? Where I'm trying to lead this is

[3529.795 - 3532.215] create a pathway of the two, three years down the road

[3532.665 - 3535.975] where people who are not suited for those seats

[3536.545 - 3538.775] eventually reach the conclusion that, Hey,

[3538.845 - 3539.935] I've had a great run.

[3540.815 - 3544.635] Let me put this in better hands here, if you may.

[3545.095 - 3547.595] And, you know, and, and we'll, we'll invite you for dinners

[3547.595 - 3548.595] and drinks and whatnot,

[3548.695 - 3552.035] but boardroom is intended for that foresight

[3552.055 - 3553.635] and insight rule here, right?

[3554.495 - 3556.435] Any thoughts anybody can share on this group

[3556.625 - 3558.515] that might be practical pointers would be helpful.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[3563.665 - 3565.185] I can jump in, but we can see if the,

[3565.205 - 3567.025] the group has crowdsourced ideas.

[3574.175 - 3578.655] Yeah. So, you know, I, I think one, let's be honest, most

[3578.655 - 3580.575] of the time it is A-A-C-E-O

[3580.595 - 3583.495] or a founder that is building, you know, their board,

[3583.495 - 3584.935] particularly at these stages.

[3585.115 - 3587.455] And the relationship that he

[3587.455 - 3591.135] or she has with, um, those members

[3591.165 - 3593.495] that have been recruited is important to this.

[3593.635 - 3596.175] And so I, I'm not sure you rely on self-reporting

[3596.175 - 3599.375] for each director to, to say what their skills are

[3599.395 - 3601.015] and if they scale to the next level.

[3601.335 - 3605.055] I think, um, you know, I think the, the people tasked

[3605.055 - 3606.055] with recruiting the board

[3606.115 - 3609.575] or the ones that have to make their own assessment of that

[3609.755 - 3612.655] and about what the company needs, oftentimes that's a CEO.

[3613.315 - 3615.415] But one thing that's occurred to me in this conversation

[3615.525 - 3620.455] that um, uh, I I think is an interesting thought is,

[3620.595 - 3623.185] is there value in, in,

[3623.245 - 3626.065] in paneling a nominating corporate governance committee

[3626.165 - 3627.265] at an earlier stage?

[3627.375 - 3628.705] It's not something that's required

[3628.795 - 3630.145] until you're a public company.

[3630.985 - 3632.665] I tend to not be a fan of,

[3632.905 - 3635.345] I certainly don't want people building bureaucracy

[3635.925 - 3637.625] or building committees

[3637.625 - 3639.585] and structure that you're not going to use.

[3640.565 - 3643.745] Um, however, on that, the other side of

[3643.745 - 3646.865] that coin is when you impanel something like a committee

[3646.925 - 3649.385] and give it a charter, it tends to do things.

[3649.805 - 3652.225] And, you know, that may be a way,

[3652.365 - 3656.505] if you have the right people to, um, to join it

[3656.685 - 3660.105] and lead it to, to create some leadership and,

[3660.125 - 3662.865] and activism around thinking about this issue

[3662.885 - 3664.825] and being proactive in terms of how

[3664.825 - 3668.185] to shape the board in conjunction with the CEO's needs.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[3669.555 - 3672.055] You know, it's interesting. We did a, an exercise at one

[3672.055 - 3674.375] of my companies where we did that competency chart

[3674.515 - 3676.295] and we asked directors to fill it out

[3676.295 - 3678.775] and we debated having the nominating corporate governance

[3678.775 - 3680.655] committee fill it out for the whole board,

[3681.355 - 3682.495] and ultimately we're pushed

[3682.495 - 3684.495] to have each director self-report,

[3685.185 - 3687.615] which was really an interesting lesson in who's an easy

[3687.635 - 3688.975] grader and who's a hard grader.

[3689.755 - 3693.295] Um, ultimately though, we used that as an exercise to try

[3693.295 - 3696.055] to identify a phenotype for a candidate search

[3696.055 - 3697.975] that we wanted to kick off that management was pushing

[3698.035 - 3700.615] for an additional director and wanted to get

[3700.615 - 3702.215] to an alignment on a profile.

[3702.835 - 3705.575] You know, it can be a helpful way to try to do it.

[3705.955 - 3708.095] And you can design that chart, right?

[3708.115 - 3709.495] You don't have to take a generic

[3709.495 - 3710.655] chart that you find from somebody.

[3710.655 - 3712.455] You can design the chart to match

[3712.455 - 3714.415] what you think is important in the skillset.

[3715.195 - 3717.335] And, you know, depending on the honesty

[3717.335 - 3719.175] and the self-awareness of your board,

[3719.315 - 3721.415] you can have a pretty good discussion around that.

[3721.915 - 3724.695] And to the point made earlier by Alan, like, you could have

[3724.695 - 3725.895] that at the, at a board meeting

[3725.955 - 3729.255] and you, you'd need a director to lead that typically

[3729.255 - 3731.825] with a little bit of humility, right?

[3732.105 - 3733.105] Somebody who can come in and say,

[3733.465 - 3735.905] I know I don't get a five in every one of these categories.

[3735.935 - 3738.305] There's certain areas as I bring strength in other areas

[3738.305 - 3740.725] where I defer to others, and that's a healthy dynamic.

[3741.605 - 3743.885] I think you can set it up and have that conversation,

[3743.985 - 3747.245] but identifying sort of where the gaps are

[3747.825 - 3750.245] can be a really important way as a first step

[3750.265 - 3752.725] to then saying, okay, how do we apply this to our board

[3752.725 - 3754.005] and say, do we have the right people?

[3754.455 - 3756.005] Where do we need to go over time?

[3756.865 - 3758.245] And you know, you, you often,

[3758.625 - 3760.125] if you sit in enough board meetings, right,

[3760.125 - 3763.165] you hear feedback about the CEO, you'll hear them talking.

[3763.165 - 3766.365] You'll say like, you know, you need mentorship in this area,

[3767.065 - 3768.525] and you're like looking around the board table

[3768.525 - 3770.085] and you're like, well, none of you have that skillset,

[3770.385 - 3772.245] so maybe that's a gap, right?

[3772.475 - 3774.615] So there are opportunities where you can do it,

[3774.615 - 3776.495] and I do think there's an important role that,

[3776.605 - 3778.455] that we play in this discussion, right?

[3778.455 - 3780.375] Even where the CEO might be the one

[3780.875 - 3784.135] to have the awkward conversation with the director, right?

[3784.135 - 3787.495] There's a conversation to be had with the CEO internally

[3787.605 - 3789.895] that says, here's where we are, right?

[3789.895 - 3792.015] Everything's a continuum. We're gonna try to get

[3792.015 - 3794.775] to this later stage in our life cycle.

[3794.995 - 3796.935] We need to look like this when we get there,

[3797.635 - 3798.815] how do we plan for it?

[3798.815 - 3801.015] How do we get ahead of it? And those have been some

[3801.015 - 3803.735] of the conversations I've had with my CEOs in, in the course

[3803.735 - 3806.095] of my career where I feel like I'm adding a lot of of value

[3806.715 - 3808.495] and where I can be a thought partner for him

[3808.495 - 3810.455] or for her to try and have those conversations

[3810.455 - 3811.735] and be proactive so

[3811.735 - 3813.335] that you're not sitting at the org meeting

[3813.355 - 3815.855] and going, oh, right, we need a financial expert.

[3815.915 - 3816.915] Who do we have?

**[Speaker 18.0]**


[3817.995 - 3820.095] So our company was recently acquired

[3820.275 - 3821.415] by a private equity firm

[3821.795 - 3824.335] and they required the entire executive team

[3824.355 - 3827.135] to undergo disc assessment, um, tests.

[3827.915 - 3829.775] And we all thought that was kind of silly.

[3830.475 - 3833.295] Um, but once we got the results we were

[3833.785 - 3836.335] after, we were all horrified at our own results.

[3837.875 - 3840.135] We were encouraged to share them with each other and,

[3842.135 - 3844.315] and also we're trying to hire a new CFO.

[3844.615 - 3848.035] Um, and they were required to take the DISC assessment

[3848.335 - 3852.025] and some people were eliminated immediately

[3852.025 - 3856.025] because they didn't indicate the traits that were desirable

[3856.165 - 3857.985] for the particular role, you know,

[3858.605 - 3863.175] but it also shows there, there's lots of stuff like how

[3863.175 - 3864.535] to communicate with people and so forth,

[3864.555 - 3867.495] but you can also identify, do these people have the traits

[3867.495 - 3872.215] that are associated with the role of a board member

[3872.485 - 3873.735] that you are desiring?

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[3877.845 - 3879.135] It's really interesting. I can do it.

[3879.135 - 3881.535] We just did a disc for our executive team last week.

[3881.695 - 3884.295] I did it for my legal team in July

[3884.295 - 3887.855] because I think it's a really great exercise to go through.

[3887.965 - 3889.415] I've done it, did it years ago at

[3889.415 - 3891.055] TripAdvisor a number of times.

[3891.955 - 3893.935] Um, we had the discussion about

[3893.935 - 3896.255] as we add board members in the future, would we do that?

[3897.215 - 3898.375] I think it's a useful tool.

[3898.495 - 3899.655] I would add, and, and this is kind

[3899.655 - 3901.255] of coming from our moderator, that like,

[3902.365 - 3903.995] don't use this as a hiring tool.

[3903.995 - 3905.395] Like, I think it's a dangerous thing.

[3905.435 - 3907.675] I mean, our, our executive team, I think like a lot of you,

[3908.335 - 3909.755] you'll find out if you've done it,

[3910.295 - 3912.355] is gonna over index towards the ds.

[3912.675 - 3913.835] I think that's sort of a natural,

[3914.715 - 3918.165] a natural thing in leadership, but just

[3918.165 - 3920.085] because you over index there doesn't mean you want,

[3920.085 - 3923.245] don't wanna hire an I for your CFO,

[3923.345 - 3925.085] for example, whatever it may be.

[3925.805 - 3927.645] I, I just think that's it.

[3927.755 - 3929.285] It's a tool, not something

[3929.285 - 3930.605] that should be used as a determinant.

[3930.945 - 3932.285] Um, but I, I don't think

[3932.285 - 3933.325] there's anything scary about it either.

[3933.325 - 3934.565] And I'm someone who's a convert.

[3934.765 - 3936.525] 'cause when I first heard these 10 years ago, my god,

[3936.595 - 3939.925] more HR process stuff, that's a waste of my time.

[3940.065 - 3942.325] And I acknowledged that I was wrong about it

[3942.385 - 3943.645] and I found it really helpful.

[3944.225 - 3947.485] But I also, it's a, I almost think it's a little dangerous

[3947.485 - 3949.725] to lean on it too much also.

[3949.975 - 3951.205] Sorry Julie, I didn't mean to interrupt.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[3952.855 - 3955.715] No, it's totally fine. So I wanna make sure we also have

[3955.715 - 3957.235] space for folks who have other topics

[3957.265 - 3958.395] they want us to go into.

[3958.455 - 3959.835] So if there're folks who have other

[3960.655 - 3962.685] directions they want this conversation to go,

[3962.765 - 3964.965] I wanna give a pause and let folks jump in with questions.

[3971.765 - 3973.225] All right. Well, while folks are thinking I'll,

[3973.225 - 3975.225] I'll take us in a slightly different direction.

[3975.805 - 3976.985] Um, Kat

[3976.985 - 3980.025] and Alan, how do you think about best interacting

[3980.025 - 3981.385] with your board, right?

[3981.385 - 3982.905] What are some of the best practices

[3982.905 - 3984.665] that you would recommend in terms of

[3985.265 - 3986.465] managing the board relationship

[3986.485 - 3989.025] and managing how the board gets information flow?

[3989.645 - 3992.225] Um, I'll, I'll throw a couple of thoughts that I have in,

[3992.295 - 3993.665] into the mix, but open

[3993.665 - 3995.625] to obviously others from around the room.

[3996.085 - 3997.585] You know, we, we think a lot about

[3998.085 - 4001.225] how do we deliver materials to the board that are secure,

[4001.485 - 4004.185] but also positioning well for discussion

[4004.285 - 4006.145] and for decision making at the meetings

[4006.565 - 4009.025] and having this balance between pre-reads

[4009.085 - 4011.185] and discussion at the meeting and,

[4011.285 - 4013.305] and not just reading slides to them.

[4013.905 - 4015.745] I don't think anyone at any company feels like

[4015.745 - 4016.785] they get it perfectly right.

[4016.885 - 4020.385] But I'm curious as to what you think are some best practices

[4020.385 - 4023.225] because for us, you know, I, I struggle with the fact

[4023.225 - 4024.625] that I'm not confident that a lot

[4024.625 - 4025.865] of folks do all the pre-reading,

[4025.865 - 4028.665] which is a really frustrating feeling, but a reality.

[4029.205 - 4031.225] And at the same time, you know,

[4031.405 - 4032.705] you don't wanna be reading slides

[4032.725 - 4033.945] and it's really disheartening

[4033.945 - 4036.025] to the leadership team if you feel like you put all this

[4036.025 - 4037.065] work into the materials

[4037.085 - 4039.065] and then you're sort of reading them

[4039.065 - 4040.105] to the, to the board members.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[4042.745 - 4044.715] Yeah, I I think you're right about,

[4044.975 - 4047.515] um, no one ever getting that right.

[4047.675 - 4049.315] I do a lot of board self-evaluations

[4049.315 - 4052.395] and I think it's commonly a topic from one end

[4052.395 - 4054.035] to the other for a complaint.

[4054.295 - 4058.555] Um, I do most commonly hear directors asking for

[4059.065 - 4062.955] more strategic discussion, more focused opportunity

[4063.095 - 4065.755] for dialogue and less reading of slides.

[4065.895 - 4068.115] And that's a common, um,

[4068.615 - 4072.555] common refrain I see in the chat folks saying, I, I'm not,

[4072.555 - 4074.395] I'm skeptical that people do the pre-read.

[4075.235 - 4077.515] I think you gotta count on 'em to do the pre-read.

[4077.855 - 4081.035] Um, and you gotta think about replacing 'em if they're not.

[4081.335 - 4082.555] But, um,

[4085.445 - 4087.025] the pre-read can be voluminous.

[4087.385 - 4090.705] I think, uh, having a common pattern so that people know

[4090.705 - 4092.705] where to look for updates on the information,

[4093.205 - 4095.57] but also really doing an executive summary

[4096.425 - 4099.885] or some way to highlight, you know, these are,

[4099.975 - 4102.925] these are the 10 things that jump out on the screen.

[4102.925 - 4106.205] They're not buried on page 80 that, you know, our,

[4106.825 - 4109.325] our CAC is going down or are we're having a churn problem

[4109.385 - 4110.605] or, you know, whatever it might be.

[4111.025 - 4113.765] Um, we're gonna call that to your attention so you see it.

[4114.385 - 4117.645] And by the way, these are the three questions that I want us

[4117.665 - 4119.885] to discuss and focus on at this board meeting.

[4120.025 - 4121.765] And so, you know, having that front

[4121.765 - 4124.565] and center, like the first page of the board package so

[4124.565 - 4127.605] that people can, um, can focus in on

[4127.605 - 4130.285] what the key data is they need to pick up and then go deeper

[4131.145 - 4133.165] and they can start thinking in advance about

[4133.195 - 4134.245] what the questions are.

[4135.025 - 4137.605] Um, and then just from the, the governance perspective,

[4137.635 - 4139.725] this is a little more boring than that topic,

[4139.985 - 4143.645] but, um, preor organizing,

[4143.875 - 4147.005] what is the approval agenda both from, you know, a list

[4147.005 - 4148.165] of items that need to be approved,

[4148.165 - 4150.765] but also actually drafting the resolutions in advance,

[4151.425 - 4152.645] you know, where there are blanks

[4152.645 - 4154.925] or decisions that need to be made, you know,

[4154.925 - 4156.165] leaving that decision tree.

[4156.185 - 4159.325] And clearly, I, I find these situations in board meetings

[4159.325 - 4161.285] where that isn't done from time to time.

[4162.025 - 4164.485] You come away as, as council trying to draft minutes

[4164.545 - 4165.605] and it's not totally clear

[4165.605 - 4167.365] that everybody did agree on the same thing.

[4168.345 - 4170.285] Um, getting it in front of them so

[4170.285 - 4172.765] that they're actually looking at a concrete, you know,

[4173.165 - 4175.045] resolution or program that they're passing and,

[4175.465 - 4178.005] and making sure that's written down I think can be valuable.

[4178.005 - 4180.965] And so I, I like to do a meeting with, um,

[4181.035 - 4183.205] inhouse council a week before a board meeting.

[4183.385 - 4186.285] We work together on going through the agenda items,

[4186.285 - 4188.205] getting the resolutions drafted, running

[4188.225 - 4189.525] to ground any open issues

[4189.585 - 4192.805] or problems, um, so that that's all prepackaged

[4192.945 - 4194.365] and ready to go and organized

[4194.365 - 4196.005] by the time the board package comes along.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[4197.315 - 4199.285] Yeah, I would, uh, so I think, uh,

[4199.425 - 4202.405] one point I think Meredith put in the chat was like the, uh,

[4202.565 - 4204.125] I think that's the Amazon style, right?

[4204.155 - 4208.085] Like Amazon starts every single meeting with like the first

[4208.605 - 4209.605] whatever, 10 or 15 minutes

[4209.625 - 4211.965] or for people to like literally sit quietly and read.

[4212.585 - 4215.765] Um, I, I kind of side a little bit with Alan in the sense

[4215.765 - 4218.645] of like, you know, you don't often have, you know,

[4218.645 - 4220.325] boards aren't meeting that frequently.

[4220.585 - 4223.045] Uh, it's usually four to six meetings a year.

[4223.665 - 4226.605] Um, and the expectation is that they would, um,

[4226.755 - 4228.565] that they would hopefully be doing a pre-read.

[4228.585 - 4230.765] But I think in order to ensure

[4230.765 - 4232.565] and set yourself up for success

[4232.825 - 4236.445] or to, um, you know, one is, uh,

[4236.905 - 4238.045] to I think Jolie's point,

[4238.045 - 4239.605] like putting together like an executive summary

[4239.605 - 4243.085] that's like pretty, you know, tight that's gonna hit on all

[4243.085 - 4244.805] of the major points is gonna be important.

[4244.865 - 4246.325] So if someone is short on time,

[4246.715 - 4249.285] they at least have a single source that is gonna have all

[4249.285 - 4252.645] of the material points that need to be conveyed to the board

[4252.705 - 4255.045] and potentially teed up for discussion in,

[4255.065 - 4256.125] in an executive summary.

[4256.785 - 4260.245] Um, followed up by, you know, like the more robust kind

[4260.245 - 4263.365] of PowerPoint that's gonna have all of the, you know,

[4263.575 - 4265.085] let's dive into the details.

[4265.545 - 4267.925] And then there's a completely separate much, much,

[4267.925 - 4270.605] much shorter deck that will just guide the discussion.

[4270.865 - 4272.805] Uh, and the, the talking points

[4272.805 - 4274.455] for the actual meeting itself,

[4274.465 - 4276.175] those shouldn't be the same deck.

[4276.175 - 4278.695] They need to be separate decks, which is the deep dive

[4279.315 - 4281.295] and then the actual presentation deck.

[4281.835 - 4283.615] Um, and then there's also just some nuts

[4283.615 - 4284.615] and bolts things too.

[4284.685 - 4286.415] Like I know a lot of folks are moving

[4286.515 - 4288.855] to actual board, um, platforms.

[4289.435 - 4292.455] So meaning making sure that your board members actually know

[4292.455 - 4295.095] how to access and use the platform, um,

[4295.955 - 4297.935] or if you're, you know, using Google Docs

[4297.935 - 4299.495] or whatever it is, just making sure

[4299.495 - 4302.415] that folks technologically can get a hold of the docs.

[4302.475 - 4304.615] That's, I think a kind of a bit of a complaint

[4304.615 - 4307.335] that I've seen from, from board members that they, you know,

[4307.335 - 4308.855] quote, I didn't know how to download it

[4308.875 - 4310.815] or I didn't know how to get the materials.

[4310.885 - 4312.335] It's a, it's a low bar thing,

[4312.395 - 4314.135] but um, just something that you should,

[4314.275 - 4315.335] you should be checking on.

[4316.155 - 4318.375] Um, and again, like also just making sure

[4318.375 - 4320.175] that you get the materials out with

[4320.775 - 4322.135] sufficient advanced notice.

[4322.515 - 4324.455] Um, you know, I definitely think for our,

[4324.835 - 4326.855] our smaller private companies, you know,

[4327.105 - 4330.295] board materials are often going out only like less than

[4330.295 - 4331.535] 24 hours in advance.

[4331.535 - 4333.415] Sometimes it's quite a bit of a scramble,

[4333.435 - 4336.215] but I think the expectation in particular as you,

[4336.355 - 4338.895] as you grow as a company is those materials need

[4338.895 - 4341.655] to be going out with, you know, needs to be more time.

[4342.315 - 4345.055] Um, so the board actually has time to, you know, review

[4345.075 - 4347.095] and digest it, not just 24 hours

[4347.355 - 4350.575] or 36 hours notice, um, for the materials.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[4352.205 - 4355.505] And by the way, this is all more important in Zoom land

[4355.535 - 4357.665] because, um, you know, you don't,

[4357.845 - 4359.545] you have people's attention for less time

[4359.605 - 4361.425] or you should, your meetings should probably be sorter

[4361.425 - 4363.425] and more focused while, you know,

[4363.425 - 4365.265] we're in these virtual worlds.

[4365.445 - 4367.745] Um, 'cause people get fatigued more, more quickly

[4367.805 - 4372.705] and it's harder to, um, have the, the, the triggers

[4372.705 - 4375.185] that come from, um, being able

[4375.185 - 4377.145] to lay eyes on people in person and

[4377.245 - 4380.185] and respond to conversation and, and human interaction.

[4380.185 - 4383.625] So I think focusing in the meeting on the key things

[4383.625 - 4385.025] that need to be taken away is,

[4385.085 - 4386.865] is ever more important in this world.

[4387.845 - 4389.025] But like there was a question there

[4389.025 - 4390.785] that I talked over, who is Meredith?

**[Speaker 14.0]**


[4391.005 - 4393.665] Um, I, I just had a question about board portals,

[4393.925 - 4397.225] you know, like board document portals and like why

[4397.805 - 4400.185] or if people think that's really a valuable thing or not.

[4400.345 - 4402.185] I mean I know that many companies use them

[4402.805 - 4404.305] and once you get a lot

[4404.305 - 4406.185] of communications it's probably useful

[4406.185 - 4407.305] just 'cause it's all in one place.

[4407.365 - 4409.905] But I'm just curious if anyone has a view about that.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4410.495 - 4412.665] Yeah, so Meredith, I I have a couple thoughts.

[4412.705 - 4414.785] I mean they're, in terms of which one to use,

[4414.865 - 4415.945] I think they're a bit fungible,

[4416.005 - 4419.065] but I actually like them for two particular reasons.

[4419.245 - 4421.185] One is the security of the information.

[4421.925 - 4424.145] So the ability to keep your important information

[4424.205 - 4427.825] behind some sort of secure system, not just email appeals

[4427.825 - 4430.305] to me, but I also think it's really valuable

[4430.305 - 4432.865] for folks in our seat in particular, right?

[4432.965 - 4435.545] It gives me a role where I get to step in

[4435.545 - 4437.225] and say, you know, we'll manage the portal,

[4437.315 - 4438.865] we'll manage the distribution material

[4439.085 - 4441.305] and everything goes to the board through that portal.

[4442.085 - 4445.865] It gives me a lot of, um, centralization of

[4445.865 - 4447.185] how information flows out

[4447.185 - 4448.305] and puts me in the middle of it,

[4448.635 - 4450.665] which I think is good from a governance perspective

[4450.805 - 4452.86] and also an information flow perspective.

[4453.125 - 4454.885] 'cause I know what's gonna be going in front of the board.

[4455.645 - 4458.185] So I, I think selfishly I like it for both those reasons.

[4458.345 - 4459.825] I don't know if other folks have different views.

**[Speaker 16.0]**


[4460.925 - 4463.865] You, one thing you may wanna consider is there's some

[4464.065 - 4465.785] literature out there in recent case law,

[4465.785 - 4470.485] certainly in Delaware on when some

[4470.485 - 4471.885] of these things become discoverable

[4472.025 - 4474.125] and, uh, how to manage the

[4475.215 - 4476.965] litigation holes and things like that.

[4477.075 - 4479.885] Just making sure that, you know, the, the, the line between,

[4481.105 - 4482.205] uh, uh,

[4482.835 - 4485.245] what information should remain privileged is actually

[4485.515 - 4486.765] remaining privileged and all.

[4487.185 - 4488.845] And I think doing that from uh,

[4489.195 - 4493.895] portals is much easier than using their own personal emails

[4494.315 - 4497.375] or God forbid you actually provide them a company email

[4497.375 - 4500.415] address and, and then, you know, have to deal with that.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[4501.605 - 4504.055] Yeah, I I, I think actually that's a, that's a important,

[4504.205 - 4506.495] like, it seems like a small point,

[4506.555 - 4509.695] but I, I think there was recent case law that came out of

[4509.695 - 4511.295] where when you're emailing your board

[4511.295 - 4513.615] and they're using like not, you know,

[4513.615 - 4516.735] company email addresses, it's gonna jeopardize privilege.

[4516.755 - 4520.775] And so I think that's why using potentially a a, a system,

[4520.775 - 4523.015] like I saw many people mention Diligent, that's what a lot

[4523.015 - 4524.415] of my clients have used as well.

[4525.235 - 4527.535] Um, you know, using a system

[4527.795 - 4530.735] or if you're not gonna use the system actually creating like

[4530.795 - 4534.295] an alias for your board, you know, like if it's board at,

[4534.635 - 4536.575] um, you know, your company name.com

[4536.575 - 4539.135] or something like that, uh, to,

[4539.235 - 4541.575] to keep your privilege tight, um,

[4541.675 - 4544.135] and to make sure you don't have any accidental leakage.

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[4547.845 - 4551.665] I ask a, We think as much that that's privileged

[4552.175 - 4553.625] from in a, in a board deck.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4555.195 - 4556.705] Sorry, there Certain, there could be,

[4556.715 - 4559.025] we've certainly had things where we had derivative lawsuits

[4559.025 - 4560.465] or other things like that where we were getting

[4560.465 - 4561.625] advice or sharing advice.

[4561.625 - 4563.305] We would typically not put it in the slides.

**[Speaker 15.0]**


[4563.565 - 4565.745] That's what I was say. I don't put anything I have like

[4565.745 - 4567.545] legal update is what I put in this slide.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4568.125 - 4569.425] No, we've done that Diane,

[4569.485 - 4571.705] but we've also had to do resolutions in some cases

[4571.805 - 4574.625] and at least those could theoretically have something in it.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[4575.785 - 4578.465] Y yeah, no, or if you're just emailing out the materials,

[4578.485 - 4581.265] people then just start replying on the thread, right?

[4581.365 - 4582.625] And they just start saying things

[4582.965 - 4586.065] and you can't control necessarily what people reply back

[4586.065 - 4587.425] to you, right?

[4587.605 - 4588.985] So I think that's part of the concern.

[4589.085 - 4591.545] It shouldn't, it's not just the materials themselves,

[4591.645 - 4593.785] but it's the dialogue that could follow them.

[4594.405 - 4596.825] Um, that, that we also wanna be really mindful of.

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[4597.645 - 4599.185] So I have a question. Do have a question?

[4599.455 - 4601.825] Yeah, I have a, well I have a question sort of like,

[4602.025 - 4604.985] piggybacking on all of this, which is like,

[4606.285 - 4609.105] and I think it's uh, Diane, it's sort of like what,

[4609.505 - 4610.905] touching on what you just said,

[4611.005 - 4615.145] but like when you do need to communicate those sensitive,

[4615.215 - 4618.065] like let's call 'em low lights, um, of the quarter

[4618.325 - 4622.065] or you know, whatever period to the board of directors, like

[4622.285 - 4625.625] how do people think about like, navigating that?

[4625.885 - 4628.185] Is it something that we should be documenting

[4628.185 - 4629.205] in a board deck board?

[4629.205 - 4631.125] Is it something that we should just be talking about

[4631.155 - 4632.485] with like the audit committee?

[4633.635 - 4635.645] Just what are, what's the, what are the thoughts on that?

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4640.255 - 4642.465] What else wanna go? And Karen, if you,

[4642.565 - 4644.865] if you're talking about, you know, the data of, you know,

[4644.865 - 4647.145] the results for the quarter, those, those are facts, right?

[4647.145 - 4650.025] Those are what they are. If you're talking about, I

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[4650.105 - 4653.765] Mean I'm, I'm talking about like just issues like yeah,

[4654.025 - 4657.165] Oh we Had a, we had a quality issue like this past

[4657.165 - 4659.405] quarter and like here's the download of it.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4660.835 - 4663.525] Yeah, I mean, I'm a big believer in thinking really

[4663.525 - 4664.885] strategically about what should be in writing

[4664.885 - 4666.885] and what should not be in writing to Diane's point.

[4667.645 - 4668.965] I, you know, I think there are a lot of times

[4668.965 - 4671.845] where you might put, you know, a, a topic for discussion

[4671.845 - 4672.845] but not put the detail

[4673.385 - 4676.045] or you might put, you know, just so you just lead that

[4676.045 - 4677.885] to an exec session and bring it up verbally

[4677.885 - 4678.925] if that makes the most sense.

[4679.505 - 4681.965] You know, it is important to think about record keeping

[4682.025 - 4683.165] and, and who's gonna have access.

[4683.225 - 4685.525] And especially if you have investors on your board

[4685.525 - 4687.165] who are used to pulling the deck down

[4687.365 - 4688.845] and sharing it with everybody at their firm,

[4688.855 - 4690.165] which is something to think about.

[4690.825 - 4691.885] You wanna be really mindful.

[4692.245 - 4693.885] 'cause you know, there, there may be loss

[4693.885 - 4695.125] of privilege along the way through that

**[Speaker 5.0]**


[4695.895 - 4696.505] Yeah. Loss

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[4697.325 - 4698.945] As well as with minutes, you know, I do,

[4698.945 - 4702.545] they should typically be topic level items, not details

[4702.545 - 4703.705] of who said what to whom.

[4703.725 - 4705.545] And you know, what the background is.

[4706.105 - 4709.545] 'cause um, you don't know where they're gonna come up again,

[4709.545 - 4711.625] whether with other employees internally

[4711.925 - 4715.185] or um, next investment round

[4715.185 - 4717.265] or an acquisition, oftentimes that's a due,

[4717.265 - 4718.825] that's a due diligence request these days.

[4718.925 - 4720.865] And you can push back, but you may not win that.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4722.755 - 4724.415] One Of the other things on board portals is

[4724.415 - 4726.335] that you can use them for secure emails.

[4726.955 - 4729.095] So you can send materials and you can send an email,

[4729.195 - 4731.255] but have it go through a secure mechanism.

[4731.355 - 4733.415] So the content of the email doesn't even show

[4733.415 - 4734.495] up on their phone.

[4734.885 - 4736.535] They have to log in to see the email.

[4736.965 - 4738.175] Just something else to think about.

**[Speaker 11.0]**


[4738.625 - 4739.895] Julie, has that been a challenge?

[4740.035 - 4743.135] So I, I'm watching diligent literally this week, you know,

[4743.375 - 4746.735] with board members, uh, some of whom are already on diligent

[4746.735 - 4748.375] for other boards, some of whom are not.

[4748.955 - 4751.935] And so I'm trying to balance how much we're using

[4752.695 - 4755.255] diligent versus how much accepting the reality

[4755.255 - 4757.455] of my CEO is going to email his board as well.

[4757.765 - 4760.935] Like how much is in the portal, obviously the materials

[4760.935 - 4762.975] for the board meetings, audit committee, et cetera,

[4763.315 - 4767.295] versus what's happening via email in terms

[4767.295 - 4768.975] of like general discussions to the board

[4769.045 - 4770.055] outside of the portal.

[4770.315 - 4772.415] So I'm kind of curious how people have found that,

[4772.415 - 4773.775] because I imagine there's probably some

[4774.575 - 4776.135] variance in that experience.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[4777.105 - 4779.995] Yeah, and I certainly push hard that everything should go

[4779.995 - 4781.355] through the portal and I don't

[4781.355 - 4782.435] win a hundred percent of the time.

[4782.615 - 4785.115] But, you know, the things that we tend to get

[4785.675 - 4788.275] pushback on are things like press releases.

[4788.495 - 4790.155] If we're giving them a press release right

[4790.155 - 4792.475] before it issues, they're like, well, it's gonna be public.

[4792.695 - 4794.115] I'm like, yeah, but it's not public yet.

[4794.135 - 4796.235] And I, I tend to fall back to Meredith's point about

[4796.765 - 4800.355] let's have the directors have one stop shopping for all

[4800.355 - 4801.795] of our content in one place.

[4802.955 - 4804.035] I have a four month old daughter

[4804.055 - 4805.355] and she's on my lap, so I apologize.

[4806.055 - 4808.205] Uh, but in addition to that, I would say that, you know,

[4808.285 - 4810.085] I think it can be challenging.

[4810.345 - 4812.405] It, it does go to quality control.

[4812.985 - 4814.845] You can leverage that argument sometimes.

[4814.915 - 4817.725] Data security is a big one I use to try and push for it.

[4818.185 - 4820.085] And I, and I do think the one-stop shopping

[4820.085 - 4821.405] makes it easier for directors.

[4821.405 - 4823.205] So they're not saying, wait, where is this thing?

[4823.865 - 4826.765] And the things that we end up at the outside the portal tend

[4826.765 - 4828.845] to be things like succession planning

[4829.335 - 4830.885] where it's super sensitive

[4830.885 - 4832.725] and they don't want everyone to have access to it.

[4832.725 - 4834.925] And maybe that got sent by the CEO separately.

[4835.395 - 4836.485] It's not my preference,

[4836.505 - 4838.085] but it's a fight that I might not win.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[4839.625 - 4842.995] Yeah, I I often see friction in the adoption process

[4843.795 - 4847.035] directors who are not that tech savvy complaining about it

[4847.095 - 4848.835] or who just wanna work a certain way.

[4849.055 - 4851.835] And, you know, I think there's that initial adoption curve

[4851.835 - 4854.555] that can, can be painful and it does generate complaints,

[4854.655 - 4855.955] but it, it has value

[4856.015 - 4858.755] and benefits to the company if you can get people over the

[4858.755 - 4860.435] hump and working that way.

[4861.175 - 4863.915] The other place that comes up a lot is airplanes.

[4864.175 - 4867.115] Um, you know, I, I want to be able to get on the plane

[4867.175 - 4868.275] to fly to the board meeting

[4868.335 - 4871.995] and I wanna, you know, be able to have access to it in paper

[4872.135 - 4876.235] so I can read it or, you know, on my download from my iPad

[4876.235 - 4877.675] or something not logging into a portal.

[4877.855 - 4880.355] And to the extent it's pushing people to

[4880.905 - 4882.075] that, that's one Gotcha.

[4882.145 - 4884.435] That I think we haven't seen the end of yet is airplane,

[4885.135 - 4886.835] um, airplane internet.

[4887.175 - 4890.555] Um, you know, I am sure you've seen some of the studies

[4890.615 - 4892.715] and news stories with reporters who've managed

[4892.715 - 4895.435] to pull just crazy things off of the wifi

[4895.465 - 4896.795] that are floating around the cabin.

[4897.015 - 4899.675] And so, I mean, really your directors should not be

[4900.455 - 4903.435] on an internet reading anything confidential on the plane.

[4903.715 - 4904.995] 'cause it's, it's not secure.

[4905.735 - 4907.955] Um, I had a crazy situation where a director

[4908.515 - 4911.235] FaceTimed into a board meeting from an airplane, um,

[4911.985 - 4913.715] that bad behavior in multiple ways,

[4913.855 - 4915.995] but, uh, another one to watch out for.

[4916.735 - 4917.735] So

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[4922.835 - 4926.275] I was gonna ask a much more rudimentary question than the

[4926.325 - 4927.755] stuff you guys are all talking about.

[4928.705 - 4931.475] Okay. Um, so when I came into the company,

[4932.875 - 4934.585] there was no delegation of authority.

[4934.755 - 4936.825] There was no, like, there was just like, it was very,

[4937.005 - 4939.785] you know, early stage willy-nilly decision making.

[4939.965 - 4941.825] And I slowly sort of implemented

[4942.755 - 4945.525] what I would call like pretty minor controls,

[4945.545 - 4946.805] levels of controls.

[4947.755 - 4950.285] Like what's, where is there a playbook somewhere

[4950.285 - 4952.445] that I should be following to get from here to there?

[4953.685 - 4955.225] You know, I mean, I've looked

[4955.245 - 4956.385] on, you know, I've looked at, do

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[4956.385 - 4958.265] I remember Rachel, that you're and all

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[4958.265 - 4959.265] The tech GC sources,

[4959.405 - 4962.345] and honestly, it's hard to stomach paying a lawyer hundreds

[4962.345 - 4965.075] of dollars an hour to tell you what's like,

[4965.075 - 4967.035] mostly common sense stuff, right?

[4968.045 - 4969.985] But just figuring out how to get from here

[4969.985 - 4971.625] to there is a tough thing.

[4971.625 - 4975.065] Like you all are talking about portals for board members.

[4975.175 - 4978.985] Well, all of our board members are, you know, either the,

[4979.365 - 4984.055] the, the two co-founders or the investors, right?

[4984.675 - 4986.285] And those seats are just,

[4986.825 - 4988.445] are just appointed by those people.

[4988.585 - 4992.045] And so they're gonna get data daily communications from us.

[4992.205 - 4994.535] I can't control any of that, right?

[4995.795 - 4997.295] So we're in a really different place.

[4998.155 - 5000.335] And I, I've talked to a bunch of lawyers, lawyers

[5000.335 - 5003.015] that do other work for us, you know, at, at big law firms,

[5003.085 - 5005.535] what I would call fancy schmancy law firms.

[5006.115 - 5007.735] And their advice isn't particularly helpful

[5007.735 - 5009.935] because they're not used to dealing with a company

[5009.955 - 5012.895] of my size, um, or a stage.

[5013.435 - 5016.095] So what's the, you know, what's the playbook in, in

[5016.275 - 5017.975] to get from here to there, right?

[5018.035 - 5021.015] Say there's a plan to IPO in the next three to five years

[5021.875 - 5023.575] to get from here to there

[5023.675 - 5026.455] and to train people in those decision making processes

[5026.455 - 5027.695] so when they get there, they're ready.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[5028.725 - 5030.935] Yeah. I, I think it's incremental change, right?

[5030.975 - 5033.655] I mean, so I do see I'm maybe guilty of being part

[5033.655 - 5035.015] of a fancy schmancy law firm.

[5035.375 - 5038.775] Um, I, a lot of my clients are pure startups.

[5038.885 - 5041.655] They evolve exactly the way you're describing.

[5041.995 - 5044.175] And you know, I, I don't think you can,

[5045.195 - 5049.335] you can jump in at a series A round with one angel investor

[5049.395 - 5052.655] or you know, super angel or something and, and try

[5052.655 - 5055.215] and establish public company controls and procedures.

[5055.275 - 5059.055] But I think you want to see, um, the,

[5059.055 - 5060.855] the board governance process making

[5061.135 - 5062.295] progress along the way, right?

[5062.355 - 5066.255] So pick your battles, um, what's important, where, where,

[5066.385 - 5068.295] where is my, where are my biggest risks

[5068.395 - 5071.455] or where are decisions getting made that are outside

[5071.455 - 5072.375] of the eye shot of the board

[5072.375 - 5073.415] and that's gonna create a problem.

[5073.515 - 5077.575] And how do I start to channel that into board channels, um,

[5078.435 - 5080.495] and accept the fact that it's, you know,

[5080.515 - 5083.415] you can't boil the ocean and you can't change it overnight.

[5083.675 - 5086.055] Um, if I remember right Rachel, you have a,

[5086.595 - 5087.935] an acquirer who's coming in

[5087.935 - 5090.775] and they're gonna be establishing their own controls

[5090.775 - 5094.975] and procedures so that that may happen faster than, um, my,

[5094.975 - 5097.215] my guess is that there's gonna be a pretty clear, you know,

[5097.495 - 5099.015] edict from corporate about, you know,

[5099.015 - 5100.095] what the rules are now.

[5100.995 - 5103.975] Um, so that may be out, out of your hands in a way.

[5104.275 - 5107.615] Um, but I, but I think in general, as you evolve, you,

[5107.755 - 5110.495] it can't be a sudden last minute thing that, you know,

[5110.495 - 5113.695] you've, um, you've grown all the way from zero

[5113.875 - 5115.895] to 60 miles an hour without doing it

[5115.895 - 5117.735] and then suddenly, you know, turn it on.

[5117.795 - 5120.055] So I, I think you just make progress along the way.

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[5120.535 - 5122.575] I mean, part of the things I'm thinking about is wanting

[5122.575 - 5124.895] to know the answers before I'm told what the answers are.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[5125.845 - 5127.695] Yeah. And I think that's a big piece of it, Rachel. Right?

[5127.695 - 5129.175] Right. We might wanna set up a structure

[5129.175 - 5130.575] that you're comfortable with as a team

[5130.625 - 5131.935] about what would go to the board

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[5132.275 - 5135.895] Before, before we're told by our new investors, here's

[5135.895 - 5137.975] what we want and this is the structure we wanted in,

[5138.075 - 5140.015] but the upshot of that is I have to make it up

[5141.285 - 5142.385] and like it's ama

[5143.005 - 5145.265] and I don't know if anyone here has come across resources

[5145.265 - 5146.585] that are useful in that scenario,

[5146.725 - 5148.785] but like, I haven't done it before.

[5148.885 - 5150.865] I'm, this is a, my first time in this role,

[5150.865 - 5152.745] so I haven't done it before. Yeah.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[5153.065 - 5154.385] Put, put the question out to the group

[5154.385 - 5156.105] because there are good resources on this.

[5156.555 - 5159.305] We've always done it with a blend of sort of dollar limits,

[5160.065 - 5161.905] a question about whether authority is limited

[5161.925 - 5163.645] to subject matter area or not.

[5163.955 - 5166.245] Yeah. And then certain categories of things

[5166.245 - 5167.525] that have to go to the board.

[5167.945 - 5170.565] And that list is helpful both for somebody like you

[5170.565 - 5171.685] or me in the seat to know

[5171.685 - 5173.245] what things we have to take to the board.

[5173.625 - 5175.925] But it's also a way of giving the board kind of comfort

[5175.985 - 5177.965] of like, look, these are the big things you are gonna get

[5177.965 - 5180.485] to weigh in on them and these other things are gonna be

[5180.515 - 5183.405] operational or they're within budget or things like that.

[5183.455 - 5185.005] We're gonna be able to execute without

[5185.005 - 5186.325] necessarily coming back to you.

[5186.825 - 5189.005] And those tend to be easy to pick out

[5189.005 - 5191.205] because they're the things that would require board approval

[5191.205 - 5193.565] anyway, like putting in place a loan facility

[5193.585 - 5194.885] of a certain size, right?

[5194.885 - 5196.605] You're gonna go to the board doing an acquisition

[5197.145 - 5198.605] of a certain size, like those kinds of things.

[5198.715 - 5200.045] Like, that's like the sleeve.

[5200.905 - 5202.925] I'm happy to give that to the board, you know,

[5203.245 - 5205.565] a commercial agreement that's 4 million in spend,

[5205.565 - 5208.215] but it's in budget, you know,

[5208.255 - 5209.535] I don't think you should have to go to board for that.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[5211.705 - 5216.185] Yeah. One, this is not

[5216.785 - 5219.025] oriented the way you're asking, but one resource that comes

[5219.025 - 5221.185] to mind is the NVCA forms.

[5221.485 - 5223.705] You go to nvca.org, there's a,

[5224.505 - 5227.625] a model investor rights agreement in there that would have,

[5227.845 - 5229.385] you know, a whole list of things that

[5230.345 - 5233.025] VC directors think are important that they go to the board.

[5233.285 - 5235.105] And you could use that as a list to go through

[5235.105 - 5236.505] and decide whether you also do.

[5237.585 - 5240.685] Um, but that might give you sort of, you know, the,

[5240.745 - 5242.645] the catchall of possibilities.

**[Speaker 13.0]**


[5244.425 - 5248.995] Yeah. Corporation, we have a delegation of authority

[5248.995 - 5250.315] and we have those sorts of things.

[5250.705 - 5253.715] It's, it's in part just like setting that culture around

[5253.745 - 5255.035] what gets shared and what doesn't.

[5255.135 - 5258.155] And sometimes in some categories we overshare probably,

[5258.215 - 5260.115] and in other categories we unders share, right.

[5260.135 - 5264.145] And it's trying to figure out how to, how to, how

[5264.145 - 5265.385] to guide that in the right direction.

[5265.725 - 5268.865] Mm-hmm. Um, which is, is tough without, you know,

[5268.865 - 5271.065] there's like most things that we, we, we do,

[5271.125 - 5272.305] we have rules, right?

[5272.605 - 5274.425] And this is a very, it's very amorphous.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[5275.975 - 5279.675] Mm-hmm. Well this has been a really helpful

[5279.675 - 5281.795] conversation and I think Tara would tell us

[5281.795 - 5284.315] that we're running up in time, um,

[5284.495 - 5285.795] and probably should wrap up.

[5285.795 - 5286.795] So I'll turn it back to you, Tara.

**[Speaker 0.0]**


[5288.745 - 5290.165] Yes. I, um,

[5290.675 - 5293.165] just wanna reiterate thank you everyone for joining.

[5293.585 - 5297.405] Um, I put this code for CLE in the chat.

[5297.635 - 5299.485] I'll also be following a post event.

[5299.615 - 5301.645] There are a couple articles that were shared,

[5301.665 - 5303.165] so we'll include those as well.

[5303.945 - 5307.405] Uh, but thank you to Jolie for being our tech GC host

[5307.585 - 5310.445] for the evening, and thank you to Alan

[5310.445 - 5313.405] and Kat from Fenwick for sponsoring this event.

[5314.025 - 5317.605] Um, their contact information will also be included in the

[5317.605 - 5318.965] post event email.

[5319.665 - 5322.405] Um, and this was a great conversation.

[5322.405 - 5326.045] Hopefully you all, uh, found it very valuable

[5326.505 - 5328.885] and, um, thanks for your time tonight.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[5330.325 - 5331.825] Thanks everyone. Thanks everyone.

[5331.825 - 5332.625] Enjoyed meeting with you.
