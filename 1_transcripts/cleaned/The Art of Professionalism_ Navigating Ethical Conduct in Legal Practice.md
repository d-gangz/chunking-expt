**[Speaker 2.0]**


[01:33 - 01:34] So much.

[01:34 - 01:36] Hi everyone. My name is Jasmine Singh

[01:36 - 01:39] and I'm your moderator today on behalf of Law Trades.

[01:39 - 01:42] Law Trades is an on-demand legal talent platform

[01:42 - 01:44] that I have used and loved for years, so I'm really excited

[01:44 - 01:46] to be moderating on their behalf.

[01:46 - 01:49] Um, I am general counsel at a company called binti,

[01:49 - 01:53] which is a SAS company that makes software for child welfare

[01:53 - 01:55] agencies to help support the foster

[01:55 - 01:57] and adoptive care processes.

[01:58 - 02:01] Uh, before binti, I was deputy GC at Patreon, and

[02:01 - 02:03] before that I was assistant GC at Pinterest.

[02:04 - 02:08] I started at Binti about two years ago as a solo GC

[02:08 - 02:10] who had a strong background in primarily

[02:10 - 02:11] commercial transactions.

[02:11 - 02:14] And before that in big law commercial litigation, um,

[02:14 - 02:18] as many of you fellow solo Juicies know, um,

[02:18 - 02:20] being a solo juicy in a space that's very complicated

[02:20 - 02:22] and delicate like child welfare

[02:22 - 02:24] during a major economic downturn

[02:24 - 02:27] where I was really limited in what resources I could use

[02:27 - 02:31] and in what advice I could help get from outside counsel,

[02:31 - 02:34] I started finding myself thinking a lot about the ethics

[02:34 - 02:37] of practicing while being stretched very thin.

[02:38 - 02:40] Um, and it's for that reason that I was really excited

[02:40 - 02:42] to moderate this panel.

[02:42 - 02:44] I, I knew that I wasn't alone in this feeling of, um,

[02:44 - 02:47] navigating what felt like the impossible task

[02:47 - 02:50] of balancing ethics and bandwidth.

[02:50 - 02:53] Um, the same balancing act can come in navigating the

[02:53 - 02:56] various other ethical issues that come our way as lawyers

[02:56 - 02:57] of tech companies generally.

[02:57 - 02:59] Um, when all of us are working at the cutting edge,

[03:00 - 03:02] we oftentimes are far ahead of the rules

[03:02 - 03:05] and regulations that may eventually apply to our industries.

[03:06 - 03:08] And for that reason, I'm really excited

[03:08 - 03:09] to be in conversation with Catherine

[03:09 - 03:12] and Amelia about these really important topics today.

[03:12 - 03:15] Um, I'm gonna let them each introduce themselves briefly.

[03:15 - 03:17] And Catherine, I'll start with you.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[03:19 - 03:22] Hi, everyone. Uh, it's a pleasure to be here today.

[03:22 - 03:25] I was actually quite honored when they asked me to speak

[03:26 - 03:27] as part of this program.

[03:27 - 03:31] I mean, as a gc obviously you want to be constantly

[03:31 - 03:35] and consistently, if not the most ethical person in the

[03:35 - 03:38] room, part of the tone from the top, uh, kind

[03:38 - 03:40] of culture carrier with respect

[03:40 - 03:43] to high ethical standards at your organization.

[03:44 - 03:47] I think we have all seen firsthand too the pitfalls

[03:47 - 03:51] of having issues, um, even if unethical,

[03:51 - 03:55] improper inappropriate, that can create legal work

[03:55 - 03:56] for ourselves when that happens.

[03:58 - 04:01] Um, I am Chief Legal officer of SIBO Digital,

[04:01 - 04:06] which is a regulated, uh, platform exchange

[04:06 - 04:09] and clearinghouse for crypto futures derivatives and spot.

[04:10 - 04:13] Prior to that, I was general counsel of Maple Finance, uh,

[04:13 - 04:16] which was decentralized finance, um,

[04:16 - 04:20] a defi protocol in crypto purview, particularly interesting

[04:20 - 04:22] during 2022.

[04:22 - 04:24] And then prior to that, I was a partner with King

[04:24 - 04:27] and Spalding in white collar defense government

[04:27 - 04:30] investigations, corporate compliance and regulatory matters.

[04:30 - 04:32] So lots to talk about with respect

[04:32 - 04:34] to all three of those roles.

[04:35 - 04:37] I'll also say that I think from my perspective,

[04:38 - 04:40] how I see this discussion,

[04:40 - 04:41] and we're gonna talk a little bit more about this.

[04:42 - 04:44] Jasmine alluded to this, but in the tech space,

[04:44 - 04:46] but particularly in the crypto space,

[04:47 - 04:48] we are at a very interesting time.

[04:49 - 04:52] We're oftentimes, uh, crypto market participants,

[04:53 - 04:56] their best practices inherently conflict

[04:56 - 04:59] with the position certain regulators are taking.

[05:00 - 05:02] So you have to ask yourself, is this unethical?

[05:02 - 05:05] Is this in, in inappropriate, is this illegal?

[05:06 - 05:09] Or, you know, my question that I'm always asking myself,

[05:09 - 05:10] can I sleep at night?

[05:10 - 05:12] Can I sit across the table from a regulator

[05:12 - 05:15] with a straight face and articulate my position

[05:15 - 05:16] based on the precedent?

[05:16 - 05:18] 'cause there's nothing in the law about this.

[05:18 - 05:20] So we'll talk a little bit more about that,

[05:20 - 05:21] but that's definitely something

[05:21 - 05:23] that I think about all the time.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[05:24 - 05:25] Thanks so much, Catherine.

[05:25 - 05:26] We're so excited that you're here

[05:26 - 05:28] and we're gonna get to hear a little bit

[05:28 - 05:29] about your experience and insight.

[05:29 - 05:31] Um, Amelia, I turn it over to you

[05:31 - 05:33] for a quick introduction as well.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[05:33 - 05:36] Sure. Thank you. Um, my name's Amelia Hinky.

[05:36 - 05:39] I am the Vice President of Legal at Business Solver.

[05:39 - 05:41] We do health and welfare benefits administration.

[05:42 - 05:44] Uh, prior to my role at Business Solver,

[05:44 - 05:48] I held a dual hat role as the Vice President of Legal

[05:48 - 05:52] and people at, uh, a smaller tech company called File Vine,

[05:52 - 05:54] which is a legal tech organization.

[05:55 - 05:58] Um, when I was approached about being a panelist

[05:58 - 06:01] for today's conversation, uh, similar to Catherine,

[06:01 - 06:04] I was very flattered, also felt a little bit nervous.

[06:04 - 06:07] I don't know that I am truly an expert in this space,

[06:08 - 06:10] but I think we all have to kind of navigate

[06:10 - 06:14] and figure out, um, how to, how

[06:14 - 06:17] to conduct ourselves ethically in these organizations.

[06:17 - 06:21] Um, because I had a dual hat role, um, overseeing the legal

[06:21 - 06:25] and HR operations in a previous, um, in a previous role,

[06:26 - 06:28] I think that can, um, create some challenges.

[06:28 - 06:29] I'm excited to kind of talk through that.

[06:30 - 06:34] Um, as well as just different things I've learned.

[06:34 - 06:36] I've, I've actually always been an in-house attorney.

[06:36 - 06:38] I don't have the practice, um, of,

[06:39 - 06:40] of being in private practice prior

[06:40 - 06:43] to joining an in-house organization.

[06:43 - 06:47] Uh, and so I think that there is, you know, there's a lot

[06:47 - 06:49] that, um, when you're in-house, you're kind of acting at,

[06:50 - 06:51] in a dual attorney

[06:52 - 06:54] and a business advisor role that you have

[06:54 - 06:55] to kind of walk a fine line.

[06:55 - 06:57] So I'm, I'm anxious to dig in and,

[06:57 - 06:59] and participate in today's conversation.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[07:00 - 07:01] Right. Thanks so much, Amelia.

[07:01 - 07:05] And you, you make such a great point, which is n none

[07:05 - 07:07] of us know whether we're experts in

[07:07 - 07:08] this space for a few reasons.

[07:08 - 07:11] One is it's constantly changing and it's complicated.

[07:12 - 07:16] And another, I think is it, this is not the easiest topic to

[07:16 - 07:19] discuss because oftentimes we might be afraid

[07:19 - 07:20] that we're not doing it right

[07:21 - 07:22] or that we got it wrong, right?

[07:22 - 07:24] And people don't love talking about those moments,

[07:24 - 07:26] especially when it comes to things like ethics.

[07:26 - 07:30] But Catherine, to the point you made, as long as we are sort

[07:30 - 07:33] of in the space of I believe that I'm doing the right thing,

[07:33 - 07:34] that goes a really long way.

[07:34 - 07:36] So I'm gonna use this moment as a reminder

[07:36 - 07:37] for the Chatham House rules.

[07:37 - 07:39] 'cause I think they really are

[07:39 - 07:41] so important in this particular space,

[07:41 - 07:44] maybe more than any others, which is, you know,

[07:44 - 07:45] we'll really have rich

[07:45 - 07:47] and deep conversation about some

[07:47 - 07:49] of these ethical quandaries if we are very confident that

[07:49 - 07:51] what we say here stays here.

[07:51 - 07:52] So I'm gonna just really encourage folks to take

[07:52 - 07:53] that commitment seriously.

[07:54 - 07:55] Um, and I'll, I'll level set

[07:55 - 07:58] before I get into some questions, which is to say

[07:58 - 08:01] that we really want, in this panel to explore the challenges

[08:01 - 08:03] and strategies for maintaining integrity

[08:03 - 08:05] and compliance with tech legal teams.

[08:06 - 08:08] We wanna address scenarios where business

[08:08 - 08:10] or clients, frankly just may not be truthful with us,

[08:11 - 08:13] and how we handle things like control person

[08:13 - 08:14] liability in those situations.

[08:15 - 08:18] Um, we wanna talk about how we as GCs foster a culture

[08:18 - 08:21] of professionalism, not just within our legal team,

[08:21 - 08:23] but across the business because we are advisors

[08:23 - 08:26] and executives within our companies, um,

[08:26 - 08:27] and navigating ethical dilemmas

[08:27 - 08:30] that can come alongside emerging technologies.

[08:31 - 08:34] Um, and really what I'm hoping that all of you get out

[08:34 - 08:36] of this panel is, um, a lot of insight from Catherine

[08:36 - 08:38] and Millie, in particular for practical methods

[08:39 - 08:40] to encourage compliance and integrity.

[08:40 - 08:42] What are some real world tips

[08:42 - 08:44] and things that each one of us are doing

[08:44 - 08:47] to help drive compliance, ethics, um,

[08:47 - 08:49] and sort of good practices

[08:49 - 08:51] and leadership in our organizations?

[08:51 - 08:54] So I'm gonna start with, with, with

[08:54 - 08:56] what I think is a really, really hard question.

[08:57 - 09:00] Uh, what happens if your business is not

[09:00 - 09:01] telling you the truth?

[09:02 - 09:04] Um, they're not giving you the whole story.

[09:04 - 09:06] You know, they maintain that they're telling you the truth,

[09:06 - 09:09] but what you know is you know that they're not, um,

[09:09 - 09:11] what do you do in those circumstances?

[09:12 - 09:14] How do you navigate that very hard scenario?

[09:14 - 09:16] Um, Catherine, let's start with you.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[09:17 - 09:19] So this arises in a couple different contexts.

[09:20 - 09:24] Um, one, when you join a new organization, I, I think

[09:24 - 09:28] that this has happened to many people where you can only get

[09:28 - 09:30] so much information through the interview process

[09:30 - 09:32] or publicly available information.

[09:33 - 09:38] And then you get in the role and you're like, oh, oh, no.

[09:40 - 09:41] And I, there's a spectrum.

[09:41 - 09:44] I mean, obviously your organization is not necessarily lying

[09:44 - 09:45] to you or lied to you.

[09:45 - 09:47] Maybe they didn't just, you know, they neglected

[09:47 - 09:50] to share some facet of information.

[09:50 - 09:53] I mean, lying by omission can be a little harsh.

[09:53 - 09:57] Uh, but that has happened to, I think, a lot of us

[09:57 - 10:00] where you realize maybe something unethical happened,

[10:00 - 10:02] maybe something inappropriate.

[10:02 - 10:04] There's a spectrum, maybe something where, okay,

[10:04 - 10:06] now I just need to remediate this.

[10:06 - 10:08] Uh, so that's happened a lot.

[10:08 - 10:11] That's probably the least worst situation.

[10:11 - 10:12] Um, you know, one anecdote

[10:12 - 10:14] that I can share is when I was in private practice,

[10:14 - 10:16] I did white collar defense.

[10:16 - 10:18] So most of the time it was representation

[10:18 - 10:21] of large entities in US government investigations,

[10:21 - 10:22] primarily DOJ,

[10:22 - 10:26] but name the regulator, did it, O-C-C-S-E-C,

[10:26 - 10:27] et cetera, all the acronyms.

[10:28 - 10:31] And sometimes it was individual defense.

[10:32 - 10:33] Most of the time it was entity defense.

[10:33 - 10:34] Sometimes it was individual defense.

[10:34 - 10:37] Sometimes it was defense of c-suite executives

[10:37 - 10:39] that were just getting interviewed as part of the process.

[10:40 - 10:42] Well, there's also a spectrum of truth telling.

[10:43 - 10:45] Like I was definitely in a couple situations

[10:45 - 10:47] where I was not convinced

[10:47 - 10:49] that my client was telling me the truth.

[10:49 - 10:52] Hmm. Sometimes I felt like I had one client in particular

[10:52 - 10:55] where I felt like he was lying to me outright.

[10:55 - 10:59] However, I didn't have evidence of that, uh, one client

[10:59 - 11:01] where I just felt like they weren't telling

[11:01 - 11:02] me the whole story.

[11:02 - 11:05] Again, kind of, is this lying by omission? Yes or no?

[11:06 - 11:08] There's a few things you can do in those scenarios,

[11:08 - 11:11] and this applies to private practice to some degrees,

[11:11 - 11:13] but it's even more important in-house.

[11:14 - 11:16] I mean, in private practice, you can fire your client.

[11:17 - 11:20] And in-house, you can also fire your client.

[11:20 - 11:22] Meaning no one ever wants to discuss this,

[11:22 - 11:25] but I have known individuals that have had

[11:25 - 11:27] to give their business an ultimatum.

[11:27 - 11:30] Like, here's my risk appetite. You choose to do this.

[11:30 - 11:32] You choose to take this course of action, that's fine,

[11:33 - 11:35] will part as friends, good luck, goodbye.

[11:35 - 11:37] Sometimes it's not will part, as friends,

[11:37 - 11:39] sometimes you might have a reporting obligation

[11:39 - 11:41] as a control person, for example.

[11:42 - 11:44] So you can always go to the extreme if it's a,

[11:44 - 11:46] if it's a case where there's some sort of unethical conduct

[11:46 - 11:50] that implicates truly illegal contact conduct,

[11:50 - 11:53] you really need to consider, do I need to go nuclear here?

[11:53 - 11:57] Do I need to consider firing my client, firing myself,

[11:57 - 11:59] you know, firing my in-house client.

[12:00 - 12:02] The other spectrum is you just convey to your client,

[12:02 - 12:03] and this is what I would do,

[12:04 - 12:06] is you're making my job 10,000 times harder.

[12:06 - 12:09] Mm-Hmm. You know, we are aligned with our strategy.

[12:09 - 12:10] We have a goal here.

[12:10 - 12:13] Whether it's you need to gimme the historical context

[12:13 - 12:15] for this product, or you need to make me understand

[12:15 - 12:17] what conversations you've had around this,

[12:17 - 12:18] or who you've told,

[12:18 - 12:22] or have you violated an NDA, fine, we will deal with it,

[12:22 - 12:24] but our interests are aligned here.

[12:24 - 12:26] And you arming me with the full spectrum

[12:26 - 12:29] of information is going to make me a better advocate.

[12:30 - 12:33] And, you know, you arming me with everything that happened.

[12:33 - 12:36] I need to be able to build a comprehensive chronology

[12:36 - 12:39] to ensure that I'm giving you the best possible strategy.

[12:39 - 12:42] Like this is gonna burn us later on if you don't arm me

[12:42 - 12:43] with this information.

[12:43 - 12:45] So oftentimes I think you can really appeal

[12:45 - 12:50] to the pragmatic, business oriented mind of, you know,

[12:50 - 12:52] your CEO, your c-suite by saying like,

[12:52 - 12:53] this is gonna hurt you

[12:53 - 12:56] and your bottom line by not enabling me

[12:56 - 12:58] and empowering me to do my job.

[12:59 - 13:02] Mm-Hmm. So I hope no one ends up in that situation,

[13:02 - 13:03] but let's be honest, I think most

[13:03 - 13:05] of us have been in some iteration of this situation.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[13:06 - 13:07] Yeah. Amelia, I'd love

[13:07 - 13:10] to hear a a little about your iteration of this situation.

[13:10 - 13:14] Yeah. Um, so I think, I think Catherine, um,

[13:14 - 13:16] said something really interesting, right?

[13:16 - 13:19] Um, about sometimes you do have to go nuclear.

[13:20 - 13:23] Um, uh, but I think that is really, uh,

[13:24 - 13:27] how you choose to go nuclear or,

[13:27 - 13:28] or how you choose to react in general.

[13:29 - 13:33] Um, your, your reaction will tell the business

[13:33 - 13:35] what they can tell you, right?

[13:35 - 13:37] And so I think that from my perspective,

[13:38 - 13:42] the most important thing I do when I start a new role, um,

[13:42 - 13:45] is really to work on building those relationships

[13:45 - 13:49] and building trust within the organization, hopefully

[13:50 - 13:54] to keep, to keep my client from lying by omission,

[13:54 - 13:57] from not telling me the whole story.

[13:57 - 13:59] Things like that. Sometimes that works

[13:59 - 14:01] and sometimes that doesn't.

[14:01 - 14:05] Um, I've had, uh, a lot of luck cultivating

[14:05 - 14:08] that trust in the organization that I'm at now.

[14:08 - 14:10] Um, that was something that was really important

[14:10 - 14:12] to me in a prior role.

[14:12 - 14:14] I led with that. Um,

[14:15 - 14:19] and I noticed that the, the communication

[14:19 - 14:22] and messaging that, that they were portraying outward so

[14:22 - 14:27] to potential clients, to, um, potential employees, uh,

[14:27 - 14:28] that were going through the interview process,

[14:29 - 14:30] didn't necessarily match up

[14:30 - 14:33] what was happening within the organization.

[14:34 - 14:37] Um, and for me, it wasn't, uh,

[14:37 - 14:40] that they were breaking any laws or, um,

[14:41 - 14:43] or even lying.

[14:44 - 14:47] It just seemed as though actions didn't match words.

[14:48 - 14:51] Um, and that's where I had to take a, a long hard look and,

[14:51 - 14:56] and see how clear am I about what matters to me

[14:56 - 14:59] and my ethics, and are my ethics aligned

[14:59 - 15:01] with the ethics of the organization.

[15:02 - 15:06] Um, and so when I think about going nuclear, it was not in

[15:06 - 15:11] that situation, uh, um, a big scary reaction

[15:11 - 15:14] that I had that, you know, you're gonna go to jail,

[15:14 - 15:15] you're breaking these laws.

[15:15 - 15:16] It wasn't anything like that,

[15:16 - 15:20] but it was, I can't continue to align myself

[15:20 - 15:22] with an organization that is not telling me the truth

[15:23 - 15:26] is not, um, doing what they say they're doing.

[15:27 - 15:29] And, and really, like, I, I can't sleep at night

[15:29 - 15:33] 'cause I just don't have a good feeling about the way

[15:33 - 15:34] that they're conducting themselves.

[15:35 - 15:36] Um, you know,

[15:36 - 15:38] but then I think, so I think there's kind

[15:38 - 15:40] of those really big scenarios where it,

[15:40 - 15:43] it really does impact your ability to do your job,

[15:43 - 15:45] your ability to be effective.

[15:46 - 15:48] But then I think, you know, we all work, uh,

[15:48 - 15:52] with sales teams, um, and they're wonderful.

[15:53 - 15:55] Um, but they're, they're clearly motivated

[15:55 - 15:57] to get deals done, to get, to get the commissions paid.

[15:57 - 16:00] And, and I think one of the other things I've experienced,

[16:00 - 16:02] and this is far lighter than, than some

[16:02 - 16:05] of the things we were just talking about,

[16:05 - 16:07] was just even misrepresenting, um,

[16:07 - 16:10] that they have obtained a certain approval that's necessary

[16:10 - 16:12] for the sales process or something like that.

[16:13 - 16:14] And that's where I would point back to

[16:15 - 16:16] the relationship of trust.

[16:16 - 16:21] Um, and, you know, I'll trust you until I, you've proven

[16:21 - 16:22] to me that, that I cannot.

[16:23 - 16:27] Um, and once you do that, then it's just really having

[16:27 - 16:28] to kind of draw the line

[16:28 - 16:33] and be willing to deal with some escalations, um, and, and,

[16:33 - 16:38] and handle it, uh, in a way that I think, um,

[16:39 - 16:41] you know, you're maintaining your professional tone.

[16:41 - 16:44] Um, but, but you know, you can,

[16:44 - 16:47] you can clearly explain why something's maybe not moving

[16:47 - 16:49] along as quickly as it should

[16:49 - 16:52] because there wasn't a, an approval obtained that needed

[16:52 - 16:54] to be approved or, or something like that.

[16:54 - 16:59] You know, I think this can really run the gamut of not all

[16:59 - 17:02] that serious, but making our jobs harder to, to really

[17:03 - 17:05] pretty serious repercussions.

[17:05 - 17:07] And I think we just need to make sure that we can,

[17:08 - 17:10] we can handle that, um, with a,

[17:10 - 17:12] with a level head. Um, yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[17:12 - 17:14] Yeah. I think a, a couple of gems from

[17:14 - 17:17] what you said is it, it can be sometimes challenging

[17:17 - 17:20] to just navigate this feeling of, I don't feel comfortable

[17:21 - 17:24] with what's happening, but I also feel like I should be the

[17:24 - 17:25] one to help make it better.

[17:25 - 17:27] And how do you decide

[17:27 - 17:30] where on the spectrum you fall on any given day, which is,

[17:30 - 17:32] I feel uncomfortable and maybe I should walk away,

[17:32 - 17:33] versus I feel uncomfortable and I,

[17:34 - 17:35] I can improve this situation,

[17:35 - 17:38] or I can steer the ship in a better direction.

[17:38 - 17:40] So I think that can sometimes be an

[17:40 - 17:41] ethical quandary that we face.

[17:41 - 17:43] Um, and it depends probably on the magnitude

[17:43 - 17:45] of whatever the issue is that one is dealing with.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[17:46 - 17:48] Yeah. I think you raise a really good point, Jasmine.

[17:48 - 17:51] And I think it's funny, I actually, um,

[17:51 - 17:54] in a prior organization, uh, had that exact conversation

[17:54 - 17:56] with a colleague, right?

[17:56 - 17:58] Um, didn't feel comfortable about the

[17:58 - 17:59] direction things were going.

[18:01 - 18:03] If there's going to be a change made,

[18:04 - 18:07] I feel like I have an ethical duty to try to make

[18:07 - 18:12] that change, whether it's in, you know, diversity, equity

[18:12 - 18:15] and inclusion initiatives or, or things like that.

[18:16 - 18:18] Um, and so for me, in that scenario,

[18:19 - 18:20] I set myself a timeline.

[18:20 - 18:24] Mm-Hmm. Um, I'm going to give this 12 more months

[18:24 - 18:26] to see if I can make any kind of impact.

[18:26 - 18:30] I had to kind of be really clear about assessing, okay.

[18:30 - 18:34] As of today, this is where we're at, indications of success

[18:34 - 18:37] that I have made any kind of difference in this organization

[18:37 - 18:39] and that we're moving in the right direction would look

[18:39 - 18:41] like X, Y, or Z.

[18:42 - 18:44] Um, and then I, I have to be honest and,

[18:44 - 18:46] and check in

[18:46 - 18:48] with myself at the six month mark at the 12 month mark

[18:48 - 18:50] to see if there are progressions.

[18:50 - 18:54] And then at that point, if they're not at that point, I,

[18:55 - 18:57] I like the way Catherine, Catherine

[18:57 - 18:58] said it, I fire my client.

[18:58 - 18:59] I remove myself from the organization,

[18:59 - 19:04] and I, I find something more aligned with, with what is true

[19:04 - 19:06] and authentic and ethical to me. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[19:07 - 19:08] I, I, the additional recall I'll offer,

[19:08 - 19:11] and this will pull from another one of your threads, Amelia,

[19:11 - 19:13] about the sales team in particular, is, you know,

[19:13 - 19:17] oftentimes sales teams have different, um, charters

[19:17 - 19:19] or missions of their own, right?

[19:19 - 19:22] Like, by any means possible, which they, they may take

[19:22 - 19:23] as like, I can break any rule

[19:23 - 19:25] and I can do whatever I want, if that's the charge

[19:25 - 19:26] that my leadership is giving me.

[19:27 - 19:30] Or sort of like, do anything possible, breakthrough walls,

[19:30 - 19:32] but do it in a way that's ethical and compliant.

[19:32 - 19:37] And, you know, I, that is, I think the, the tread

[19:37 - 19:40] that my team tend tends to take is we wanna do anything

[19:40 - 19:42] to break through these walls, and

[19:42 - 19:43] we don't wanna break rules.

[19:43 - 19:44] We respect rules, especially

[19:44 - 19:47] 'cause we at ti do government contracts.

[19:47 - 19:49] Mm-Hmm. Um, but what's really fascinating

[19:49 - 19:50] for me in the ethical space

[19:50 - 19:52] of government contracts is we have a lot of folks

[19:52 - 19:54] that come from bigger organizations who will say

[19:54 - 19:56] to me things like, Jasmine, you're telling me I'm not

[19:56 - 19:57] allowed to do X, Y, and Z,

[19:57 - 19:59] but I did it at so and so big company.

[20:00 - 20:02] And so I'm not sure why we're being more risk averse than

[20:02 - 20:06] them, or, you know, uh, I, I'm pretty sure it's allowed

[20:06 - 20:08] because I've done this a thousand times before.

[20:08 - 20:11] And navigating that ethical quandary

[20:11 - 20:12] and sort of demonstrating

[20:12 - 20:14] that this is not necessarily about risk tolerance.

[20:15 - 20:18] It's about, you know, what you like commitment

[20:18 - 20:19] to upholding the law.

[20:20 - 20:23] And sometimes I feel like that gets thrown into the mix

[20:23 - 20:25] as like, oh, we're being too risk averse.

[20:26 - 20:29] And I like to remind folks like, it is not risk averse

[20:29 - 20:33] to uphold your ethical obligation to comply with loss.

[20:33 - 20:36] Right. Um, and in, in moments there may be some stretch,

[20:36 - 20:38] there may be some interpretation,

[20:38 - 20:39] there may be some challenge, especially

[20:39 - 20:40] in unregulated areas.

[20:40 - 20:41] Right. And Catherine, I know

[20:41 - 20:42] we've got a lot to go with there.

[20:43 - 20:47] Um, but I, I think it's a unique question to add to the mix

[20:47 - 20:49] of like, how do we think about risk

[20:49 - 20:50] and ethics in particular?

[20:51 - 20:54] And, you know, how do you make sure that you, yourself, can,

[20:54 - 20:56] Catherine speaking to your point earlier, sleep at night,

[20:56 - 20:59] feeling like you gave the right advice in the context

[20:59 - 21:01] of your company, your business, and yourself.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[21:02 - 21:05] I like using the response that resonates with parents.

[21:06 - 21:08] Like different families have different rules. Sorry.

[21:08 - 21:10] I love that. You know, it doesn't matter.

[21:10 - 21:12] Uh, you know, we set the standard here.

[21:12 - 21:14] It's absolutely necessary.

[21:15 - 21:18] And one thing I wanted to chime in on here,

[21:18 - 21:19] because I think it's really relevant too,

[21:20 - 21:23] a question someone just asked in the chat is, you know,

[21:23 - 21:24] someone just noted that they'd like

[21:24 - 21:27] to hear perspectives on answering questions without having a

[21:27 - 21:29] doubt deep well of expertise to draw from,

[21:29 - 21:32] and not always having a, you know, a go-to advisor on some

[21:32 - 21:35] of these questions and everything we're talking about now.

[21:36 - 21:37] Like, we're presuming

[21:37 - 21:40] that the ethical quandary is gonna arise from the business.

[21:40 - 21:42] So you know, we're gonna be the ones to step in and fix,

[21:43 - 21:47] but there's also, as equally as an important task as GC

[21:47 - 21:49] to be comfortable with your own ethical standards

[21:49 - 21:51] with respect to dispensing advice.

[21:52 - 21:55] Mm-Hmm. And especially for the solo GCs out there.

[21:55 - 21:56] I hear you. I see you.

[21:56 - 21:58] When I left private practice

[21:58 - 22:00] and became a gc, I was a solo gc

[22:00 - 22:02] and I had an investigations

[22:02 - 22:03] regulatory litigation background.

[22:04 - 22:08] So you can imagine, I mean, a lot of the traditional m

[22:08 - 22:10] and a corporate work, I was kind of like,

[22:11 - 22:12] I have no idea what I'm doing.

[22:12 - 22:16] Right. And I think we've had a, a lot of people have had

[22:16 - 22:19] that, whether it's industry specific, there's gaps,

[22:19 - 22:22] whether it's practice specific, it's hard

[22:22 - 22:25] to go into a GC role where you don't have that.

[22:25 - 22:28] And, you know, different GCs cover different areas.

[22:28 - 22:30] For example, at sibo, I'm able to rely on some

[22:30 - 22:33] of the SIBO legal team, which I wasn't able to do at Maple.

[22:34 - 22:36] So with those types of issues,

[22:37 - 22:40] per maybe it is arguably unethical to give advice

[22:40 - 22:43] to your client, to your organization if you really have no

[22:43 - 22:44] idea what you're talking about.

[22:44 - 22:47] So you have to assess your own standards

[22:47 - 22:50] and your own comfort level in terms of what you're willing

[22:50 - 22:51] to teach yourself

[22:51 - 22:53] or learn versus what you're willing to say,

[22:54 - 22:55] no, I need to put my foot down.

[22:55 - 22:57] I need to talk to outside counsel.

[22:57 - 22:58] I need additional resources.

[22:59 - 23:00] My way of dealing with

[23:00 - 23:03] that was always understanding the spectrum

[23:03 - 23:04] of risk to the company.

[23:04 - 23:07] Mm-Hmm. So if this was something like an NDA

[23:07 - 23:09] or a garden variety contract

[23:09 - 23:12] or a training where, you know, you could go in to L suite

[23:12 - 23:13] and pull a sample

[23:14 - 23:16] and you could feel comfortable

[23:16 - 23:18] that even if you messed it up, the risk

[23:18 - 23:21] or the damage to the organization was almost non-existent

[23:21 - 23:23] or immaterial, sure, go do it.

[23:23 - 23:25] Go educate yourself. Go learn.

[23:25 - 23:27] But you know, even if you don't know

[23:27 - 23:29] what you're talking about, you do understand

[23:29 - 23:32] how much damage, for example, you know, having a,

[23:33 - 23:35] a damages provision in a contract,

[23:35 - 23:38] like in a significant deal, could, could, you know, exert

[23:38 - 23:40] or a lot of the other scenarios

[23:40 - 23:43] where it could be quasi existential to your company.

[23:44 - 23:45] Those are the ones where you need to assess,

[23:46 - 23:48] are you well placed to go out on a limb

[23:48 - 23:49] and advise your client?

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[23:50 - 23:53] Mm-Hmm. Amelia, how have you dealt with that sort

[23:53 - 23:54] of ethical quandary of like,

[23:54 - 23:57] n not necessarily knowing all the substantive answers,

[23:57 - 23:59] but feeling like you maybe should

[23:59 - 24:00] or want to know or want to answer?

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[24:01 - 24:05] Yeah, I think, um, as a, you know, generalist, by

[24:07 - 24:10] the nature of always having been in-house, um,

[24:10 - 24:13] my knowledge is broad, but not super deep in certain areas.

[24:14 - 24:17] So, um, so like Catherine said, I have

[24:17 - 24:20] to get comfortable in the areas where I feel

[24:21 - 24:22] comfortable giving advice,

[24:23 - 24:26] and also really understand what it would take for me

[24:26 - 24:30] to get the depth of knowledge, um, needed

[24:30 - 24:31] to answer the question.

[24:32 - 24:34] Um, so if it's something that, you know,

[24:35 - 24:37] I could do a little bit of legal research on

[24:37 - 24:41] and feel convicted that, hey, this is the right answer,

[24:41 - 24:43] and I, I would've spent a couple hours doing

[24:43 - 24:46] that work, I will do that all day.

[24:46 - 24:49] But I think that there's also, as a, as an advisor

[24:49 - 24:52] to the business, right, there's an opportunity cost in me

[24:53 - 24:56] spending all of that time researching the topic

[24:56 - 24:57] and getting the knowledge.

[24:57 - 25:00] And so I kind of, I try to position it in such a way

[25:00 - 25:03] of like, Hey, this is not my area of expertise.

[25:03 - 25:05] I think it would be best for the organization,

[25:06 - 25:08] and we'll actually probably save some money if we can just

[25:08 - 25:11] go to an expert in this topic Mm-Hmm.

[25:11 - 25:13] Um, get the quick answer,

[25:13 - 25:15] and then we can kind of decide from there.

[25:16 - 25:20] Um, I, you know, there are certain areas, um, that I,

[25:20 - 25:21] I always say I don't touch,

[25:21 - 25:25] and that's immigration, um, IP licensing, and,

[25:25 - 25:26] and we'll always have m

[25:26 - 25:30] and a council handle the big deals, um, for us other, like,

[25:30 - 25:31] you know, employment matters.

[25:32 - 25:34] If it gets to litigation, of course we will,

[25:34 - 25:36] but we can probably navigate most of those in-house.

[25:36 - 25:40] And so I just kind of get pretty clear about the areas

[25:40 - 25:43] that I'm comfortable advising on, and, and when I'm not,

[25:43 - 25:45] or stepping outside of that wheelhouse, I,

[25:45 - 25:48] I very quickly would raise that flag to the organization

[25:48 - 25:51] and be prepared to, to pull somebody else in. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[25:52 - 25:54] And I'll, I'll share my personal experience

[25:54 - 25:56] as a solo GC in a company

[25:56 - 25:58] that had never had legal counsel before.

[25:59 - 26:02] I had to do a lot of work internally to sort

[26:02 - 26:03] of explain that.

[26:03 - 26:06] Like, no, I didn't know the answer to every possible

[26:07 - 26:08] question that could come my way.

[26:09 - 26:11] And there was sort of this expectation of like, well, you,

[26:11 - 26:13] you're just gonna do this too, right?

[26:13 - 26:14] Or like, we're not gonna have to use

[26:14 - 26:15] outside counsel at all anymore.

[26:15 - 26:20] Right. And it was sort of, you know, my process of sort

[26:20 - 26:21] of explaining to folks like, you know,

[26:21 - 26:24] you don't ask a heart doctor to do foot surgery.

[26:24 - 26:26] You know, I, I've heard so many lawyers use that analogy.

[26:26 - 26:30] I had to do that and sort of explain that, uh,

[26:30 - 26:31] time and time again.

[26:31 - 26:34] And also sort of navigate my own feeling of

[26:36 - 26:39] where do I feel ethically bound to do something,

[26:39 - 26:44] and where do I feel sort of like bound by my own sense

[26:44 - 26:45] of perfectionism?

[26:45 - 26:48] And I don't know about anybody else on this call,

[26:48 - 26:49] especially first time GCs, right?

[26:50 - 26:53] But like, that's a really hard line to unpack

[26:53 - 26:55] and sort of come away with from clarity,

[26:55 - 26:57] because there were so many times that I was eager,

[26:57 - 26:58] and I thought to myself, well,

[26:58 - 27:00] if I was perfect, I would know the answer.

[27:00 - 27:02] Or if I worked harder, I could figure this out. Right?

[27:03 - 27:05] But then sometimes reminding myself, well, like ethically,

[27:05 - 27:08] I don't feel comfortable advising on this thing, no matter

[27:08 - 27:10] how much I study up or practice

[27:10 - 27:13] or ask people in tech gc, for example, for their support,

[27:13 - 27:16] there is a limit to what I can offer to this conversation.

[27:16 - 27:19] So, for anybody else navigating this really complicated

[27:19 - 27:21] situation, no, two things.

[27:21 - 27:22] One, you're not alone. Um,

[27:22 - 27:25] and two, this community feels like a really good place

[27:25 - 27:27] to sort of ask the question of like,

[27:27 - 27:28] would you go this alone?

[27:28 - 27:30] Or how, you know, how would you deal with this?

[27:31 - 27:32] But thank you both for the insight there.

[27:33 - 27:35] Um, let's, let's change gears a little bit to,

[27:36 - 27:38] I think another topic that a lot of folks are eager

[27:38 - 27:42] to hear about, which is, um, regulatory posture,

[27:43 - 27:45] regulatory position, and when it runs counter

[27:45 - 27:46] to legal strategy.

[27:47 - 27:48] So the overarching question here is,

[27:49 - 27:51] do you think it's unethical to have a legal strategy

[27:51 - 27:54] that runs counter to a regulatory position?

[27:54 - 27:56] Um, and how do you ensure that

[27:56 - 28:00] what you're doing is ethical when there actually is no law

[28:00 - 28:01] or rule with respect to something

[28:01 - 28:03] that the business wants to pursue?

[28:03 - 28:04] So it's sort of a two part question.

[28:04 - 28:06] Um, Amelia, we'll start with you this time,

[28:06 - 28:07] and then Catherine Head over to you.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[28:08 - 28:11] Oh, I think this one, uh, is probably better posed

[28:11 - 28:14] to Catherine, uh, just given her her role.

[28:14 - 28:15] Um, I know my,

[28:15 - 28:19] our industries are not super highly regulated, so Yeah.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[28:19 - 28:21] I'm jealous of Amelia. I'm very jealous.

[28:22 - 28:24] Uh, no, I mean, I think this is a great point

[28:24 - 28:27] because as the law with emerging technologies

[28:27 - 28:28] and it tech grows

[28:28 - 28:32] and changes, like this is obviously a huge issue for crypto,

[28:33 - 28:34] for AI or cannabis.

[28:35 - 28:39] Uh, but as we see more development oftentimes even,

[28:39 - 28:42] you know, more traditional areas are going

[28:42 - 28:44] to have this issue where maybe you have a technical

[28:44 - 28:46] development and it's not explicitly blessed

[28:46 - 28:49] by the regulators, or maybe you're in an unregulated field.

[28:50 - 28:51] Like, what,

[28:51 - 28:54] how do you navigate an unregulated field for a one?

[28:54 - 28:56] You know, how do you know what is and is not okay?

[28:57 - 28:59] I think the first thing I always do is

[28:59 - 29:00] assess a spectrum of risk.

[29:00 - 29:03] You know, like with respect to looking at crypto,

[29:03 - 29:06] I always say that there's three big areas of risk.

[29:06 - 29:10] One is kind of technical hack, um, integrity, like,

[29:10 - 29:12] or your smart contracts good.

[29:12 - 29:15] Is your code good? Like obviously there's massive issues.

[29:15 - 29:19] There is, are your privacy incident response areas great.

[29:19 - 29:21] You know, you don't mess with that

[29:21 - 29:23] because like, again, that's, that's pretty existential

[29:24 - 29:25] and easy to fill a gap.

[29:25 - 29:28] Two criminal also something you don't mess with.

[29:29 - 29:33] You know, do you have, uh, A-M-L-K-Y-C sanctions in place?

[29:34 - 29:35] If you don't, you better have a darn

[29:35 - 29:37] good reason why you don't.

[29:37 - 29:39] If you're dealing with flow of funds, like,

[29:39 - 29:42] is your position justi justifiable with respect to,

[29:42 - 29:44] you know, are you, you know,

[29:44 - 29:47] theoretically helping a flow of dirty money?

[29:48 - 29:50] And this could be considered a national security risk.

[29:50 - 29:52] Like how are you dealing with that?

[29:52 - 29:53] You need to have an answer to that,

[29:53 - 29:55] and it needs to be a very good one.

[29:55 - 29:59] The third one, regulatory, like civil regulators, cryptos,

[30:00 - 30:03] it's no, no, uh, no secret that cryptos parts

[30:03 - 30:06] of crypto are kind of at war with the SEC.

[30:06 - 30:08] Well, how, how is that? Okay.

[30:08 - 30:10] How can you be at war with your regulator,

[30:10 - 30:12] if not your current regulator,

[30:12 - 30:14] if your unregulated potentially your future regulator

[30:14 - 30:18] with respect to your posture with the CFTC or the SEC?

[30:19 - 30:23] I would always say that at Maple, I spent a lot

[30:23 - 30:27] of time on a proactive, regular regulatory strategy

[30:27 - 30:30] that enabled me to feel comfortable

[30:30 - 30:33] that this was justifiable based on everything that existed.

[30:33 - 30:37] Whether that is law precedent, rules, guidance,

[30:37 - 30:41] like anything that was out there, I had a response.

[30:41 - 30:45] Now, would the SEC agree with my response? Probably not.

[30:46 - 30:49] But if put in front of a neutral arbiter like a judge,

[30:50 - 30:53] could I advocate for this position with a straight face?

[30:54 - 30:57] Could I convince potential strategic partners

[30:57 - 30:59] that I had done a degree

[30:59 - 31:01] of diligence on the regulatory risk?

[31:03 - 31:04] If those answers need to be, yes,

[31:04 - 31:06] those answers absolutely need to be yes.

[31:07 - 31:10] If they're not, then you're in a problematic space,

[31:10 - 31:13] you know, basically from a practical viewpoint,

[31:13 - 31:16] but also potentially from an ethical viewpoint.

[31:16 - 31:18] Hmm. So there's a lot of gray area.

[31:18 - 31:21] Part of being a GC is just having a strategy as to how

[31:21 - 31:24] to proactively navigate that gray area, ideally

[31:24 - 31:27] before you have to deal with an inquiry

[31:27 - 31:28] or with an issue. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[31:28 - 31:30] Can, let's talk a little bit how you navigated

[31:30 - 31:33] that gray area in terms of leaning on outside counsel.

[31:34 - 31:37] Um, what, what would you do in terms of asking them

[31:37 - 31:38] for their input and advice

[31:38 - 31:40] and, you know, guidance along the way?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[31:41 - 31:43] That's really tough, particularly with crypto,

[31:43 - 31:45] and again, areas of emerging technologies

[31:45 - 31:46] that are rife with risk.

[31:47 - 31:50] A lot of outside counsel these days will not give you a

[31:50 - 31:51] definitive answer, you know?

[31:52 - 31:53] No, no. Uh,

[31:53 - 31:56] law firm worth their salt will give people an opinion

[31:56 - 31:57] that a token is not a security.

[31:57 - 31:59] Mm-Hmm. Like, that's something a lot of to, uh,

[31:59 - 32:00] crypto lawyers joke about.

[32:00 - 32:02] Like, it's ridiculous. You might be able

[32:02 - 32:04] to find like a law firm in Gibraltar,

[32:04 - 32:07] but you know, no credible law firm is going to enable you

[32:07 - 32:09] to, to give you a full CYA.

[32:10 - 32:14] However, uh, this, this is often something I deploy

[32:14 - 32:15] with novel products.

[32:16 - 32:19] We are taking the position that this novel product feeds,

[32:19 - 32:22] fits this regulatory mold and is permissible

[32:22 - 32:23] because of X, Y, Z.

[32:23 - 32:24] It's a reasonable interpretation.

[32:24 - 32:27] We will seek outside counsel advice

[32:27 - 32:29] to confirm our understanding and interpretation.

[32:30 - 32:33] Mm-Hmm. Now that outside counsel memo might have caveats,

[32:33 - 32:35] but if it's overwhelmingly in support of our position,

[32:36 - 32:39] then not only do we look more credible, it's like,

[32:39 - 32:40] like an advocacy piece.

[32:40 - 32:43] It also underscores the fact that we are trying

[32:43 - 32:45] to be an ethical, you know, entity.

[32:45 - 32:47] We're trying to be a good actor in the space.

[32:48 - 32:51] We're taking our responsibilities in terms of, you know, uh,

[32:52 - 32:54] creating novel products that are good for the marketplace

[32:54 - 32:57] or, or, you know, needed in de in demand

[32:57 - 32:58] by the market participants.

[32:59 - 33:02] All of that is kind of check marks in the good actor column.

[33:03 - 33:05] Mm-Hmm. So, I like it from a, I can sleep at night,

[33:05 - 33:09] but also from our, kind of our external facing brand, uh,

[33:09 - 33:10] which is a big issue in crypto.

[33:10 - 33:13] You know, we, we are the good actors.

[33:13 - 33:15] We are doing good work for the space.

[33:15 - 33:19] We are filling a need, which also helps with the policy

[33:19 - 33:21] arguments that if you are in an emerging space

[33:22 - 33:24] or you know, a high tech growth area,

[33:24 - 33:26] you're probably also communicating

[33:26 - 33:28] with policy makers. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[33:28 - 33:30] Yeah. Okay. I'd love to hear sort of also the,

[33:30 - 33:32] the inner layer of

[33:32 - 33:34] how this manifests itself within your organization.

[33:34 - 33:37] Like, if there is ever a hum of,

[33:37 - 33:39] wait, how are we doing this?

[33:39 - 33:41] And is this legal and what's, you know, how,

[33:41 - 33:43] how are we justifying the ethics of this?

[33:44 - 33:47] How do you navigate how much you share internally

[33:47 - 33:49] to make sure that folks feel comfortable with, you know,

[33:50 - 33:51] whatever approach the business is taking?

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[33:52 - 33:55] I've always been radically transparent

[33:55 - 33:56] with the crypto regulatory environment.

[33:57 - 34:01] I have a lot of discussion with the board, my boards, um,

[34:02 - 34:05] to make sure that they feel comfortable that, you know,

[34:05 - 34:07] our strategy is well in hand.

[34:07 - 34:10] This was a big issue with a lot of the exchange lawsuits.

[34:10 - 34:12] You know, we were a spot exchange

[34:13 - 34:16] and all the spot exchanges were getting

[34:16 - 34:17] sued by the regulators.

[34:17 - 34:19] So my boards were like, what's going on here?

[34:19 - 34:22] Like, how are we doing? How are we, uh, dealing with this?

[34:23 - 34:25] So I think you have to be radically transparent, both

[34:25 - 34:27] with your governance, but also with your business.

[34:28 - 34:29] You know, on town halls,

[34:29 - 34:32] I would often give a crypto regulatory overview.

[34:32 - 34:34] Here's what we're monitoring, here's

[34:34 - 34:35] what we're doing from the policy

[34:35 - 34:37] and from the regulatory sphere.

[34:38 - 34:41] I would give weekly emails to SIBO global markets,

[34:41 - 34:43] like my parent company, senior management,

[34:43 - 34:46] that would give them regulatory and legislative

[34:46 - 34:47] and enforcement developments.

[34:47 - 34:50] And how that change was changing our strategy,

[34:50 - 34:53] or how legal was advising a pivot with respect

[34:53 - 34:56] to the business strategy based on the legal and regulatory

[34:56 - 34:57] and policy environment.

[34:57 - 34:59] Mm-Hmm. So you, the transparency

[34:59 - 35:02] and ensuring that you have this under control.

[35:02 - 35:05] We're not gonna, like, legal is not gonna bless anything

[35:05 - 35:08] by the business that we don't have a response to.

[35:08 - 35:11] We don't have a strategy, we don't feel okay with.

[35:11 - 35:15] Um, basically making sure that you know, that everyone,

[35:15 - 35:16] whether it's senior management or your board

[35:16 - 35:19] or your salespeople know that you've got this,

[35:19 - 35:22] like you've got this, like you need to have faith in your GC

[35:22 - 35:23] to kind of steer the ship.

[35:24 - 35:28] Uh, this is particularly true of any industry

[35:28 - 35:29] that's undergoing high volatility.

[35:30 - 35:34] So, you know, crypto in 2022 financial services in 2009,

[35:34 - 35:37] like, we could, we could go on and on and on. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[35:37 - 35:39] Mm-Hmm. Interesting.

[35:39 - 35:42] Um, I think the additional wrinkle I'll offer here is sort

[35:42 - 35:46] of, you know, my unique situation at Vinti is obviously

[35:46 - 35:47] government agencies are our customers.

[35:48 - 35:49] And because we support the foster

[35:49 - 35:53] and adoptive care process, we have a consumer facing

[35:53 - 35:57] or foster adoptive care facing portal that collects data

[35:57 - 36:00] on under the auspices of these agencies.

[36:00 - 36:03] And there are just a ton of unknowns with respect

[36:03 - 36:05] to government owned data, right?

[36:05 - 36:09] And the consents that they have, um, the consents

[36:09 - 36:10] that they give their vendors

[36:10 - 36:13] or their subcontractors to perform services on their behalf.

[36:13 - 36:16] And so, I think sometimes what tends to happen in,

[36:16 - 36:20] in my world is sort of this open question of, well, hey,

[36:21 - 36:24] government agency, I presume that you have the permission

[36:24 - 36:27] to do what you're doing, but actually I'm gonna stop

[36:27 - 36:28] assuming that, uh, you know,

[36:28 - 36:29] 'cause there are, there are moments

[36:29 - 36:32] where there is an open question of like,

[36:32 - 36:34] do you have the right to give me the data

[36:34 - 36:35] of these people that you're sharing?

[36:36 - 36:38] And you know, I know you've never been asked that question

[36:38 - 36:39] before, and I'm sorry to offend you,

[36:39 - 36:42] but like, this is actually part of my ethical obligation

[36:42 - 36:44] to make sure that like we in turn have the right

[36:44 - 36:46] to process this data in the ways that you're telling us to.

[36:47 - 36:49] So there's, there's an, this is less regulatory,

[36:50 - 36:52] but more really exposing that, like,

[36:52 - 36:54] sometimes there just aren't rules that cover what we do.

[36:54 - 36:55] Sometimes it's just unclear.

[36:56 - 37:00] And, um, you know, that vagueness can be a moment

[37:00 - 37:03] where you have to decide what the North Star is.

[37:03 - 37:04] And at Binti, for example,

[37:04 - 37:06] our North Star is putting children first, right?

[37:06 - 37:08] Because we support fostered adoptive care.

[37:08 - 37:12] And so all of our data decisions really index on our,

[37:13 - 37:14] is this in service of children?

[37:14 - 37:17] Because there isn't a rule that says X, Y,

[37:17 - 37:19] or Z with respect to what we can do,

[37:19 - 37:21] but is it protecting their data in the way

[37:21 - 37:23] that we know we want to, or that we care about?

[37:23 - 37:26] And that's the internal question to sort of your point

[37:26 - 37:28] with internal level setting something that I do as well,

[37:29 - 37:31] which is, you know, whenever we get internal questions about

[37:31 - 37:32] like, well, can't we just duplicate the data

[37:32 - 37:33] and put it in, blah, blah, blah?

[37:33 - 37:36] And I'm like, well, if we did, the potential risk

[37:36 - 37:38] to these children's data is blah.

[37:38 - 37:40] Right? And talking about it in that way,

[37:41 - 37:44] I think has gone a really, you know, it's gotten sort

[37:44 - 37:46] of buy-in, in a way that just saying like,

[37:46 - 37:47] no, or that's illegal.

[37:48 - 37:50] Or, you know, like, this is what, you know,

[37:50 - 37:51] the regulatory regime, or this is

[37:51 - 37:52] what the privacy regime says.

[37:52 - 37:55] PE-people are less willing, I think, to buy in sometimes

[37:55 - 37:58] to those points, um, when presented that way.

[37:58 - 38:01] And so the, the ethical connection to the rest

[38:01 - 38:04] of the business can really be values based, um,

[38:04 - 38:06] and North Star based within, you know, what the rest

[38:06 - 38:08] of the company is also orienting on.

[38:08 - 38:09] Um, and so, Amelia, I

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[38:09 - 38:11] Love that so much, Jasmine.

[38:11 - 38:14] I just have to say, I think your primary job as GC is

[38:14 - 38:16] what is the ethos of the company?

[38:16 - 38:18] Mm-Hmm. Like a hundred percent your North Star,

[38:19 - 38:20] and how are you advancing that mission

[38:20 - 38:21] with your legal strategy?

[38:22 - 38:26] And, you know, they say like, assuming ass, uh,

[38:26 - 38:27] makes an ass out of you and me.

[38:27 - 38:30] Like, it's true. I haven't heard

[38:30 - 38:32] that expression since I was basically a child.

[38:32 - 38:34] But, uh, really, like, you could,

[38:34 - 38:37] you could apply the same principle to, uh,

[38:37 - 38:39] your due diligence on strategic counterparties.

[38:39 - 38:41] Mm-Hmm. Like, we've all seen a lot

[38:41 - 38:44] of very significant examples of maybe your company wants

[38:44 - 38:47] to engage, um, or do a joint venture

[38:47 - 38:49] or do a joint press release with an entity

[38:49 - 38:51] where you're like, wait, what is this entity?

[38:51 - 38:53] What are they doing? What are they doing?

[38:53 - 38:56] And you know, I've been dismissed in the past

[38:56 - 38:58] where it's like, oh, it's three ac.

[38:58 - 39:00] All the crypto people will know that they're huge.

[39:00 - 39:03] Like they have so much money, it's fine. It's fine.

[39:03 - 39:05] And it's like, wait, let's take a closer look here.

[39:05 - 39:09] So sometimes I, I, I, you know, you don't wanna be kind of,

[39:09 - 39:13] that's not in my job description in the, the due diligence

[39:13 - 39:15] of counterparties, but to some degree,

[39:15 - 39:18] it is always your job description as GC

[39:18 - 39:21] to be asking the difficult questions. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[39:21 - 39:24] Mm-Hmm. Yeah. And Amelia, I'd love to turn it over

[39:24 - 39:26] to you to, uh, focus on that part

[39:26 - 39:27] of this discussion in terms of like,

[39:28 - 39:31] how have you thought about guiding to, you know,

[39:31 - 39:32] company North Star or ethos

[39:32 - 39:35] or really navigating some of those hard discussions?

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[39:35 - 39:39] Yeah, Jasmine, I think, um, the way that you, uh,

[39:39 - 39:42] pr like kind of teed that topic up is,

[39:42 - 39:46] is perfect at business over, um, you know, we kind of have

[39:47 - 39:51] certain pillars of, um, conduct that,

[39:51 - 39:52] that are important to us.

[39:52 - 39:54] Um, one is trust through transparency.

[39:55 - 39:59] Um, and so I think when we think about being transparent,

[40:00 - 40:03] um, that means I need to be transparent with

[40:04 - 40:07] the leadership team as I'm giving legal advice, right?

[40:07 - 40:11] I need to be able to paint the picture of, is this,

[40:11 - 40:12] you know, is this a real risk?

[40:13 - 40:16] Is this a perceived risk? And, and really how bad is it?

[40:17 - 40:22] But then that needs to trickle down to the, the, you know,

[40:22 - 40:25] boots on the ground, the people doing, um, doing the work.

[40:26 - 40:31] But then I also think about my direct reports, um, and,

[40:31 - 40:32] and the importance of transparency

[40:33 - 40:37] and building that trust, um, in, in reporting relationships.

[40:37 - 40:41] Um, you know, I have to be transparent with them.

[40:41 - 40:43] If I don't know something, if I can't,

[40:44 - 40:47] if I can't answer a question to them, I, I don't ever want

[40:47 - 40:52] to pretend or project any kind of, um, false confidence

[40:52 - 40:55] that I, that I have this all figured out, right?

[40:55 - 40:58] And so I always, um, try to lead with, um, being

[40:58 - 41:00] as transparent as possible with them,

[41:00 - 41:02] because then I think that opens the door

[41:03 - 41:05] for when they get into a situation

[41:05 - 41:07] or get backed into a corner

[41:07 - 41:09] and they're feeling like they don't know.

[41:10 - 41:12] Um, they can come to me and be transparent.

[41:12 - 41:15] So there's kind of that, um, you know, it's a,

[41:16 - 41:18] it's a culture of transparency and trust.

[41:19 - 41:22] Um, but then I think to, to pile on top of that business,

[41:22 - 41:25] olver also, uh, leads with empathy.

[41:26 - 41:28] And we think about, uh, the importance of empathy

[41:28 - 41:33] with our clients in a benefits administration space, space.

[41:33 - 41:38] Um, you know, we, our clients are, are large employers,

[41:38 - 41:41] but we also serve their employees who are going

[41:41 - 41:42] through a difficult time.

[41:43 - 41:46] Um, but it, that, that thread

[41:46 - 41:50] of empathy runs throughout every, um, possible

[41:51 - 41:55] team scenario, et cetera, within our organization.

[41:55 - 41:57] Mm-Hmm. Um,

[41:57 - 42:00] and so, you know, as I'm leading my team, the other thing

[42:00 - 42:04] that I, that I really try to keep in mind is, um,

[42:04 - 42:07] how can I be empathetic with, through what they're going

[42:07 - 42:12] through and how can I, um, show them that, uh,

[42:13 - 42:16] whatever decision that they've made, uh, whether I agree

[42:16 - 42:19] with it or not, how can I kind of relate to that

[42:19 - 42:22] and to them in an empathetic manner so

[42:22 - 42:25] that we can keep those lines of communication open so

[42:25 - 42:28] that we can continue to get better, refine the advice

[42:28 - 42:31] that we're given, given to the organization, and,

[42:31 - 42:35] and then really just be better partners

[42:35 - 42:36] and advisors to the organization.

[42:36 - 42:39] I think that's, um, that's really, really important.

[42:40 - 42:44] Um, as we're figuring out all of these ethical loopholes,

[42:44 - 42:48] like, for me, let's be transparent, let's be ethical,

[42:48 - 42:50] let's be empathetic with each other.

[42:50 - 42:53] Um, we can figure everything else out. I think

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[42:54 - 42:55] I love that. You

[42:55 - 42:58] know, I, I think it's probably rare to have a panel on

[42:59 - 43:02] ethics that is really rooted in also empathy, right?

[43:02 - 43:05] It's like the, one of the paths to ethical practice

[43:05 - 43:08] of law is actually being an empathetic person

[43:08 - 43:10] and understanding where other people come from

[43:10 - 43:11] and are coming from, so

[43:11 - 43:16] that you can better help navigate potentially to, uh,

[43:16 - 43:17] a different end goal.

[43:17 - 43:19] If, if what is happening is not the right thing.

[43:19 - 43:21] So having empathy for where they are so

[43:21 - 43:23] that you can help them get to a better place, potentially.

[43:24 - 43:27] Yeah. Um, and that's actually a perfect lead in to, uh,

[43:28 - 43:32] the next topic, which is really fostering a culture

[43:32 - 43:33] of an, of integrity.

[43:34 - 43:38] Um, how do you do that both within your legal team, um,

[43:38 - 43:40] as well as with, uh, across the business?

[43:40 - 43:44] Uh, how do you think about setting the tone from, you know,

[43:45 - 43:47] your actions, conduct and communications?

[43:47 - 43:50] How do you think about enforcing it, um, requiring it,

[43:50 - 43:52] you know, carrot stick mentality?

[43:52 - 43:53] I'd love to hear from both of you

[43:53 - 43:55] and, um, Catherine, we can start with you

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[43:56 - 43:58] A couple very practical suggestions.

[43:58 - 44:00] Once, one,

[44:00 - 44:04] I'd give the same scared straight compliance presentation,

[44:04 - 44:08] or I should say I did at Maple, where, look, we,

[44:08 - 44:11] we've all given presentations of best practices.

[44:11 - 44:13] Um, sometimes your compliance team might do that.

[44:13 - 44:16] Sometimes it means more when legal is involved.

[44:17 - 44:21] But I actually feel this presentation chock full

[44:21 - 44:24] with real life ripped from the headlines.

[44:25 - 44:27] Examples of individual liability.

[44:27 - 44:31] Like, I think you need to speak about this in, in, you know,

[44:31 - 44:34] ways that your sales guy can understand.

[44:35 - 44:37] And if you're talking about regulatory issues

[44:37 - 44:40] or implications in a way that only lawyers will understand,

[44:40 - 44:42] it's really not gonna resonate.

[44:42 - 44:45] Where if you, you know, give them concrete examples

[44:45 - 44:48] of traders who have actually served prison time

[44:48 - 44:51] because of something stupid that they put in a chat like

[44:51 - 44:53] that is a lot more impactful.

[44:53 - 44:57] So, you know, speak to like the scared straight portion of,

[44:57 - 45:00] you know, advocating for high ethical standards.

[45:00 - 45:02] Make sure you're speaking to them in a language

[45:02 - 45:04] that they can understand that that's really gonna resonate

[45:04 - 45:06] with all levels of the organization.

[45:07 - 45:10] Second tone from the top, and this is twofold.

[45:11 - 45:14] One, ensure that your organization's CEO makes this

[45:15 - 45:16] a non-negotiable.

[45:17 - 45:20] If it isn't, well that's just kind of a problem generally,

[45:21 - 45:23] and there's, it's really hard to change that, I'll just say.

[45:24 - 45:27] So maybe that's something you think about long term

[45:27 - 45:29] as you contemplate a longer term move.

[45:30 - 45:32] But two, even if your CEO is a good person,

[45:33 - 45:36] make sure he is vocally supporting legal and compliance

[45:37 - 45:41] and vocally ensuring like, we have zero tolerance for X, Y,

[45:41 - 45:44] Z, um, and make sure he

[45:44 - 45:47] or she communicates that loudly and frequently.

[45:47 - 45:51] Mm-Hmm. And then secondarily, you and your legal team

[45:51 - 45:54] and your compliance team should really be living

[45:54 - 45:58] and breathing, breathing best practices of ethical conduct.

[45:58 - 46:00] Like, I, I think we've all been there maybe in different

[46:00 - 46:04] contexts where it's someone at the holiday party,

[46:05 - 46:07] like it's the lawyer in the room who gets too drunk

[46:07 - 46:09] and starts making inappropriate comments.

[46:10 - 46:12] It, it's bad. It's a bad look.

[46:12 - 46:14] It's a terrible look actually,

[46:14 - 46:16] because I kind of think of myself as gc.

[46:16 - 46:18] Like, it's always difficult to navigate, like,

[46:18 - 46:20] I'm not here to be your mom.

[46:21 - 46:25] Uh, but I am also, and, and I wanna be your friend,

[46:25 - 46:27] and I want you to be able to come to me and confide in me

[46:27 - 46:29] and communicate with me

[46:29 - 46:30] and know that you're in a safe place,

[46:31 - 46:34] but also know that I'm not gonna b******t you.

[46:34 - 46:35] This is not okay.

[46:35 - 46:37] And my best interests are gonna lie with the company.

[46:37 - 46:40] And I expect, you know, I am a, I'm a culture carrier

[46:41 - 46:43] for top ethical standards at my organization.

[46:44 - 46:46] And I think that my team should have the same attitude.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[46:48 - 46:51] I love that. Amelia. Yeah, Catherine, I,

[46:51 - 46:52] uh, I completely agree.

[46:52 - 46:55] And I think your, uh, example about

[46:55 - 46:59] being ethical at a holiday party is the perfect one.

[46:59 - 47:03] I, a little anecdote from a, a company trip, um,

[47:03 - 47:06] that I was on earlier in the spring, um, one

[47:06 - 47:09] of our executive leaders, um, came

[47:09 - 47:11] to the table we were sitting at, it was

[47:11 - 47:13] that we were at dinner, everybody was having fun.

[47:13 - 47:16] Um, but, you know, I was sitting with the legal

[47:16 - 47:19] and compliance team and we were very quiet.

[47:19 - 47:22] Um, and the, the reaction was,

[47:22 - 47:23] you guys are the most boring people here.

[47:23 - 47:25] And it was like, thank you.

[47:25 - 47:26] I, I'll take that as a compliment

[47:26 - 47:29] because, um, it'll be really hard for me

[47:29 - 47:31] to be taken seriously

[47:31 - 47:35] and to be, um, perceived as doing my job.

[47:35 - 47:39] Well, if I'm the rowdiest most, most, uh, you know,

[47:40 - 47:42] outgoing person in the room, I I'll take

[47:42 - 47:44] being the most boring person at a party any day.

[47:45 - 47:48] Um, if it's a professional function, right?

[47:48 - 47:50] Um, I think that, that, I think that's important.

[47:51 - 47:54] Um, and like I, like I talked about

[47:54 - 47:57] before, you know, I think that, um,

[48:01 - 48:02] we just kind of need to make sure

[48:03 - 48:04] that we are approaching our,

[48:04 - 48:06] our team members where they're at.

[48:06 - 48:08] So that is being transparent with them,

[48:08 - 48:09] being empathetic with them.

[48:09 - 48:14] But I think the other thing to, um, move to the,

[48:14 - 48:16] to the front of the conversation and,

[48:16 - 48:20] and to keep it top of mind is in an organization, uh,

[48:20 - 48:22] in a tech company that we're working in,

[48:22 - 48:25] we're not working in law firms where everyone knows

[48:25 - 48:27] that lawyers have these ethical obligations.

[48:28 - 48:33] Um, and, uh, in fact, from my experience,

[48:33 - 48:34] oftentimes, um,

[48:35 - 48:38] my colleagues don't necessarily understand

[48:38 - 48:42] until I take the time to explain to them that I have a set

[48:42 - 48:47] of ethical standards that I have to maintain, um, and,

[48:47 - 48:50] and really disclose to them I am here

[48:50 - 48:51] to represent the company.

[48:51 - 48:54] The company is my client. I'm here to protect them.

[48:55 - 48:58] Um, that to me is, uh,

[48:58 - 49:02] really important in setting the stage of, of, um,

[49:02 - 49:04] conducting yourselves ethically and,

[49:04 - 49:07] and kind of helping the organization understand

[49:07 - 49:11] how your role impacts the overall organization.

[49:11 - 49:15] I think, um, we've probably all experienced, um,

[49:16 - 49:18] somebody coming to us asking, you know,

[49:18 - 49:21] about a personal legal matter, whether it's a, you know,

[49:21 - 49:23] issue with their HOA, uh,

[49:24 - 49:26] speeding ticket, something like that. Divorce.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[49:26 - 49:28] Yeah. Yeah. What was that, Catherine?

[49:28 - 49:31] Uh, I've, I've gotten a lot of people asking me for divorce,

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[49:31 - 49:32] Lawyers divorce.

[49:32 - 49:34] Yes. Yeah, exactly.

[49:35 - 49:38] Um, and, and it's just kind of having to remind them like,

[49:39 - 49:41] I, I represent the company.

[49:41 - 49:43] I, I don't, I'm not a private law firm

[49:43 - 49:44] within the organization.

[49:45 - 49:46] I don't take private clients.

[49:46 - 49:50] Um, I think that there is, uh, I, I sometimes have

[49:50 - 49:52] to take it even a step further, um,

[49:52 - 49:55] and explain to them the, the concept

[49:55 - 49:56] of unauthorized practice of law.

[49:57 - 50:00] Um, I am an Illinois licensed attorney.

[50:00 - 50:02] I sit in Salt Lake City, Utah.

[50:02 - 50:04] I hold a house counsel license.

[50:04 - 50:06] That gets me out of a lot of things, um,

[50:06 - 50:09] because I, I say I'm legally not able

[50:09 - 50:12] to represent anyone other than the organization that I work

[50:12 - 50:15] for, um, by a function of, of the license that I hold.

[50:16 - 50:20] And so just really, um, speaking to them in terms

[50:20 - 50:21] that they understand, um,

[50:21 - 50:24] and I don't think that we can diminish

[50:24 - 50:28] or take for granted the, the fact that our colleagues really

[50:29 - 50:32] do not necessarily know what it is like to work

[50:32 - 50:35] with a lawyer until we take the

[50:35 - 50:36] opportunity to talk to them about that.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[50:37 - 50:39] Mm-Hmm. Heather,

[50:39 - 50:41] I'm gonna let you do your CE code announcement. Most

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[50:41 - 50:44] Important part of the presentation is now,

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[50:47 - 50:48] Oh, you were muted.

**[Speaker 1.0]**


[50:48 - 50:49] This is such a great discussion.

[50:49 - 50:51] I'll only take a second of your time.

[50:51 - 50:53] So I just wanna quickly read out the CLE code.

[50:53 - 50:56] So please make sure that you write this down so

[50:56 - 50:58] that you can enter it into the post-event, CLE at a station.

[50:59 - 51:03] So the code for today is ethical. Again, it is ethical.

[51:03 - 51:03] That's

[51:04 - 51:09] E-T-H-I-C-A-L.

[51:09 - 51:10] Thank you.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[51:10 - 51:12] Thank you, Jasmine.

[51:12 - 51:14] One other point that I wanted to make on the back

[51:14 - 51:17] of this discussion, we've talked about real life examples,

[51:17 - 51:20] which I do find to be very effective on both individual

[51:20 - 51:22] liability, but also particularly competitors.

[51:23 - 51:25] The other thing that I would like to add is,

[51:25 - 51:28] so when I was at King and Spalding, the leader of our group

[51:29 - 51:31] of the white collar group was Chris Ray,

[51:31 - 51:33] who's now our FBI director.

[51:33 - 51:37] And, you know, politics put aside, Chris is one

[51:37 - 51:39] of the most ethical people I've ever met in my life.

[51:39 - 51:42] And I will say having him as a beacon

[51:43 - 51:46] for every other lawyer in that practice was fantastic.

[51:47 - 51:49] Like, he was an inspiration for me.

[51:49 - 51:51] It was kind of a, what would Chris do?

[51:52 - 51:54] I have a friend who's a gc, um, I,

[51:55 - 51:56] I won't name him, although he probably wouldn't be interested.

[51:56 - 52:01] He actually jokingly gave out wristbands like, uh,

[52:01 - 52:06] ww g uh, d like what would Greg do like to his c-suite?

[52:06 - 52:08] 'cause he wanted to be a constant reminder,

[52:08 - 52:09] like if they were struggling

[52:09 - 52:12] or if they were, they had an issue, they, he wanted to be,

[52:12 - 52:15] you know, on their shoulder, in their head at all times.

[52:15 - 52:18] So if you are a good example for not just your legal team,

[52:18 - 52:20] but for the rest of the team, like they know,

[52:20 - 52:23] like they take pride in the fact that they have, uh,

[52:23 - 52:25] you know, a strategic partner

[52:25 - 52:26] that's going to steer the ship.

[52:26 - 52:29] Well, that can be really inspirational.

[52:29 - 52:31] And then the other thing to convey

[52:31 - 52:33] to them too is I think most people don't understand the

[52:33 - 52:35] concept of control person liability.

[52:35 - 52:38] We haven't talked about that at all in this presentation.

[52:38 - 52:39] And it's actually essential when

[52:39 - 52:40] you're talking about ethics.

[52:40 - 52:43] Mm-Hmm. So occasionally I have reminded

[52:43 - 52:45] or informed people in the business,

[52:45 - 52:47] like I'm a control person.

[52:47 - 52:52] Like, if we get sued, like I am theoretically on the hook,

[52:52 - 52:56] like I could be subject to, you know, regulatory issues,

[52:56 - 52:58] potentially even criminal liability

[52:58 - 53:00] for my acts on behalf of the organization.

[53:00 - 53:02] So this is how seriously I take it.

[53:02 - 53:03] I take it seriously 'cause it's my job,

[53:03 - 53:04] but I also take it seriously

[53:04 - 53:07] because, you know, this is my career on the line.

[53:07 - 53:09] Mm-Hmm. So like that's going to make me, you know,

[53:09 - 53:11] make the business really understand

[53:11 - 53:13] why you're doing what you're doing. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[53:13 - 53:16] Yeah. I, I, I think to, to distill

[53:16 - 53:18] and pull out some gems from what you're all saying is,

[53:19 - 53:22] you know, the, the methods within the organization I think

[53:22 - 53:23] can be broken up into a couple different groups.

[53:24 - 53:25] One is lead by example, right?

[53:25 - 53:29] So be a beacon of transparency, of truth, of honesty,

[53:29 - 53:32] of carrying whatever the ethos of the company is.

[53:33 - 53:36] Another is sort of make sure people know the why behind the

[53:36 - 53:39] what, uh, whether that's explaining the regulatory position

[53:39 - 53:41] or your individual investment in compliance

[53:42 - 53:43] and ethical practice.

[53:43 - 53:46] So making sure that they understand in plain English

[53:46 - 53:49] what it is that is informing the company's position

[53:49 - 53:50] and your defense of that position.

[53:51 - 53:53] And it seems like another Amelia, from what you were saying,

[53:53 - 53:55] another pull for you is really, you know, going back to

[53:55 - 53:58] that point about empathy is making it so you know,

[53:58 - 54:00] you are transparent enough, uh, and,

[54:00 - 54:03] and empathetic enough that you can get people to come to you

[54:03 - 54:04] and really share what it is

[54:04 - 54:06] that maybe they're struggling with.

[54:06 - 54:09] Um, and the thing I, I can maybe add

[54:09 - 54:11] as like a sub bucket under there is, you know,

[54:11 - 54:13] the approachability factor,

[54:13 - 54:15] especially in high growth tech companies,

[54:16 - 54:19] I think really cannot be overestimated.

[54:19 - 54:22] It is so important to be a visible

[54:23 - 54:26] person within your organization as a gc

[54:26 - 54:28] or for your, the rest of your legal team

[54:28 - 54:29] to be highly visible

[54:30 - 54:32] and to be present means that people are gonna come

[54:32 - 54:34] to you when they are concerned.

[54:34 - 54:37] When they have a fear about, like, actually, I don't know if

[54:37 - 54:38] what we did over here was totally right.

[54:39 - 54:42] And I think the person I wanna talk to is Catherine Orelia

[54:42 - 54:43] or Jasmine or whoever.

[54:43 - 54:45] Um, and, and one of the things I've really tried

[54:45 - 54:48] to do since we're trying to talk about as concrete examples

[54:48 - 54:50] as possible is, I am everywhere all at once.

[54:50 - 54:52] Like I, Catherine,

[54:52 - 54:53] I follow your suit, I present at all hands.

[54:54 - 54:56] I, I attend some team meetings.

[54:56 - 55:00] I have one-on-one with staff level engineers on a regular

[55:00 - 55:02] basis, just so I can be like, Hey, what's the pulse?

[55:02 - 55:03] What's going on? Tell me about the business.

[55:03 - 55:05] Same thing with my sales team folks.

[55:05 - 55:08] And that's, you know, and that's obviously not, uh,

[55:08 - 55:11] there's not bandwidth for all of this all the time, but

[55:11 - 55:12] whenever you can do it

[55:12 - 55:14] and just be as present as possible,

[55:14 - 55:17] I think those are the moments where we can really start to

[55:17 - 55:20] not just be ambassadors of an ethical message,

[55:20 - 55:22] but be receivers of information

[55:22 - 55:25] that may be taking the company in a different direction.

[55:26 - 55:28] So I love all of that input. Thank you.

[55:28 - 55:31] Uh, I can't believe how quickly this hour has gone by.

[55:31 - 55:34] Uh, we, we'll conclude with some sort

[55:34 - 55:36] of last minute, um, advice.

[55:36 - 55:40] And the, the question is your advice to other GCs.

[55:41 - 55:44] How have your thoughts in particular changed on any

[55:44 - 55:45] of the things that we've talked about from maybe your

[55:45 - 55:48] earlier days practicing to where you are now?

[55:48 - 55:50] Um, and Amelia, we'll start with you.

**[Speaker 4.0]**


[55:52 - 55:55] Sure. Thank you. Um, I think

[55:57 - 56:00] just to kind of echo the point you just made, Jasmine, you,

[56:00 - 56:03] you can't underestimate the power of relationships.

[56:03 - 56:06] Um, and, and I think, um,

[56:09 - 56:11] from, from my perspective, the,

[56:11 - 56:14] the deeper relationships I build with my teammates, um,

[56:14 - 56:18] and with the organization, um, the easier it is

[56:18 - 56:22] to do my job and to do it, uh, ethically and,

[56:22 - 56:25] and not feel like I am

[56:26 - 56:27] doing something wrong

[56:28 - 56:30] or being pushed to do something that I shouldn't be doing.

[56:31 - 56:34] Um, I, I think that's, that's probably it.

[56:34 - 56:35] Take time to invest in those relationships.

**[Speaker 3.0]**


[56:37 - 56:38] I feel the same way. I was gonna say,

[56:39 - 56:42] my big takeaway is really ensure

[56:42 - 56:43] that you can sleep at night.

[56:43 - 56:46] You know, we've all felt very uncomfortable with, uh,

[56:47 - 56:48] it could be something the business is doing,

[56:48 - 56:50] it could be something we've been asked to do.

[56:50 - 56:53] There's definitely a line of that discomfort.

[56:53 - 56:54] Like, it's okay to be a little uncomfortable,

[56:54 - 56:56] especially when you're learning, right?

[56:56 - 56:59] But it's not okay to be uncomfortable to the point where,

[56:59 - 57:01] you know, like your moral

[57:01 - 57:04] and ethical compass is spinning in the wrong direction.

[57:05 - 57:07] You know, look, there is definitely a spectrum of that.

[57:08 - 57:10] Like, people are gonna have a different, you know, kind

[57:10 - 57:13] of moral standard, or we shouldn't even call it morality.

[57:13 - 57:15] We should say appetite for risk.

[57:15 - 57:16] Sometimes the JC isn't a fit

[57:16 - 57:18] because they have an appetite for risk

[57:19 - 57:20] that doesn't align with the company.

[57:20 - 57:24] But make sure that if your appetite for risk doesn't align

[57:24 - 57:28] with the company, then you either find an alternative job

[57:28 - 57:31] or you get comfortable with the risk that they're taking.

[57:31 - 57:35] So you can kind of ensure that you're advocating on behalf

[57:35 - 57:36] of a client that you believe in.

[57:37 - 57:40] You're not exposing yourself to control person liability,

[57:41 - 57:44] and that your longer term future isn't compromised.

[57:44 - 57:47] Like, those are all things that are very selfish, selfish

[57:47 - 57:48] as part of this calculus,

[57:49 - 57:51] but they're also really important from the kind

[57:51 - 57:53] of top down ethos of the organization. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**


[57:54 - 57:56] I love those nuggets. Thank you.

[57:56 - 57:59] Um, and I'll, I'll close this out with mine, which is,

[57:59 - 58:01] you know, to reiterate that I,

[58:01 - 58:02] I don't pretend to know everything.

[58:02 - 58:04] I'm a first time GC who's been doing this for two years.

[58:05 - 58:09] Um, and I'll share that when I first started, I had assumed,

[58:09 - 58:11] and we talked a little bit about assumptions earlier,

[58:11 - 58:14] but I assumed that a lot of the questions I had were things

[58:14 - 58:17] that other people already knew the answers to

[58:17 - 58:19] because they had been in the job longer.

[58:19 - 58:22] They had done it before, this wasn't their first GC gig.

[58:23 - 58:25] Um, and that I would just need to figure it out.

[58:25 - 58:28] But what I've realized is as two years have now gone by,

[58:28 - 58:30] I've realized that none of us, no matter

[58:30 - 58:31] how many roles we've had

[58:31 - 58:34] and how many years into either role know everything,

[58:34 - 58:35] we're all running into novel issues

[58:35 - 58:37] and questions all the time.

[58:37 - 58:39] And none of us know the answer to everything.

[58:39 - 58:43] And for me, realizing that really alleviated the pressure

[58:43 - 58:47] associated with this really tough division between

[58:47 - 58:48] what I thought my ethical obligation was

[58:49 - 58:51] and what I thought, you know, the seriousness

[58:51 - 58:53] with which I take my professional obligation

[58:53 - 58:55] and like doing my job at the best

[58:56 - 58:58] and highest capability that I can.

[58:58 - 59:01] Um, and so I came to know more deeply

[59:01 - 59:03] that while sometimes maybe precedent

[59:03 - 59:06] or other people's experience can be informative in helping

[59:06 - 59:09] address those issues, what's really steering my sort

[59:09 - 59:13] of ethical practice right now is commitment to my own sense

[59:13 - 59:16] of ethics coupled with an understanding of

[59:16 - 59:19] what the company's ethics and ethos are.

[59:19 - 59:23] And so you really have to deeply know who your company is,

[59:23 - 59:25] who it's made of, and what they believe

[59:25 - 59:26] and what their North Star orientation is.

[59:26 - 59:28] And also who you are, right?

[59:28 - 59:29] Like what, what are you comfortable with

[59:29 - 59:33] and what can you to, to Catherine's earlier point,

[59:33 - 59:35] what can you sleep at night with feeling very comfortable

[59:35 - 59:36] that you've done the right thing and

[59:36 - 59:38] that you can defend whatever positions you've taken.

[59:39 - 59:41] Um, so I'm sorry to take us a minute over.

[59:42 - 59:43] That felt like a worthwhile wrap up.

[59:44 - 59:45] Uh, thank you all so much for attending.

[59:45 - 59:47] Heather, I'll turn it over to you to close us out.
