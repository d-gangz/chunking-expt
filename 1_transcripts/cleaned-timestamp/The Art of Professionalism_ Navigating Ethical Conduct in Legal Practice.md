**[Speaker 2.0]**

[93.035 - 94.035] So much.

[94.095 - 96.235] Hi everyone. My name is Jasmine Singh

[96.235 - 99.355] and I'm your moderator today on behalf of Law Trades.

[99.775 - 102.275] Law Trades is an on-demand legal talent platform

[102.275 - 104.955] that I have used and loved for years, so I'm really excited

[104.955 - 106.235] to be moderating on their behalf.

[106.815 - 109.755] Um, I am general counsel at a company called binti,

[109.755 - 113.155] which is a SAS company that makes software for child welfare

[113.755 - 115.795] agencies to help support the foster

[115.935 - 117.555] and adoptive care processes.

[118.055 - 121.635] Uh, before binti, I was deputy GC at Patreon, and

[121.635 - 123.795] before that I was assistant GC at Pinterest.

[124.475 - 128.155] I started at Binti about two years ago as a solo GC

[128.215 - 130.315] who had a strong background in primarily

[130.315 - 131.435] commercial transactions.

[131.775 - 134.715] And before that in big law commercial litigation, um,

[134.855 - 138.115] as many of you fellow solo Juicies know, um,

[138.325 - 140.955] being a solo juicy in a space that's very complicated

[140.975 - 142.675] and delicate like child welfare

[142.815 - 144.795] during a major economic downturn

[144.885 - 147.795] where I was really limited in what resources I could use

[147.975 - 151.035] and in what advice I could help get from outside counsel,

[151.795 - 154.675] I started finding myself thinking a lot about the ethics

[154.775 - 157.795] of practicing while being stretched very thin.

[158.335 - 160.755] Um, and it's for that reason that I was really excited

[160.855 - 162.075] to moderate this panel.

[162.275 - 164.755] I, I knew that I wasn't alone in this feeling of, um,

[164.885 - 167.235] navigating what felt like the impossible task

[167.695 - 170.035] of balancing ethics and bandwidth.

[170.535 - 173.515] Um, the same balancing act can come in navigating the

[173.515 - 176.195] various other ethical issues that come our way as lawyers

[176.215 - 177.515] of tech companies generally.

[177.615 - 179.885] Um, when all of us are working at the cutting edge,

[180.345 - 182.485] we oftentimes are far ahead of the rules

[182.585 - 185.725] and regulations that may eventually apply to our industries.

[186.305 - 188.165] And for that reason, I'm really excited

[188.165 - 189.765] to be in conversation with Catherine

[189.765 - 192.565] and Amelia about these really important topics today.

[192.945 - 195.525] Um, I'm gonna let them each introduce themselves briefly.

[195.625 - 197.165] And Catherine, I'll start with you.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[199.145 - 202.685] Hi, everyone. Uh, it's a pleasure to be here today.

[202.925 - 205.645] I was actually quite honored when they asked me to speak

[206.025 - 207.045] as part of this program.

[207.565 - 211.485] I mean, as a gc obviously you want to be constantly

[211.665 - 215.165] and consistently, if not the most ethical person in the

[215.165 - 218.925] room, part of the tone from the top, uh, kind

[218.925 - 220.565] of culture carrier with respect

[220.585 - 223.325] to high ethical standards at your organization.

[224.045 - 227.765] I think we have all seen firsthand too the pitfalls

[227.905 - 231.245] of having issues, um, even if unethical,

[231.605 - 235.005] improper inappropriate, that can create legal work

[235.105 - 236.845] for ourselves when that happens.

[238.025 - 241.405] Um, I am Chief Legal officer of SIBO Digital,

[241.615 - 246.325] which is a regulated, uh, platform exchange

[246.325 - 249.685] and clearinghouse for crypto futures derivatives and spot.

[250.175 - 253.525] Prior to that, I was general counsel of Maple Finance, uh,

[253.525 - 256.805] which was decentralized finance, um,

[256.925 - 260.965] a defi protocol in crypto purview, particularly interesting

[260.965 - 262.045] during 2022.

[262.625 - 264.605] And then prior to that, I was a partner with King

[264.605 - 267.485] and Spalding in white collar defense government

[267.805 - 270.005] investigations, corporate compliance and regulatory matters.

[270.185 - 272.725] So lots to talk about with respect

[272.725 - 274.365] to all three of those roles.

[275.345 - 277.995] I'll also say that I think from my perspective,

[278.455 - 280.235] how I see this discussion,

[280.235 - 281.835] and we're gonna talk a little bit more about this.

[282.105 - 284.795] Jasmine alluded to this, but in the tech space,

[284.815 - 286.595] but particularly in the crypto space,

[287.015 - 288.875] we are at a very interesting time.

[289.565 - 292.795] We're oftentimes, uh, crypto market participants,

[293.165 - 296.275] their best practices inherently conflict

[296.705 - 299.355] with the position certain regulators are taking.

[300.055 - 302.395] So you have to ask yourself, is this unethical?

[302.415 - 305.275] Is this in, in inappropriate, is this illegal?

[306.015 - 309.115] Or, you know, my question that I'm always asking myself,

[309.295 - 310.355] can I sleep at night?

[310.655 - 312.755] Can I sit across the table from a regulator

[312.755 - 315.035] with a straight face and articulate my position

[315.125 - 316.235] based on the precedent?

[316.755 - 318.195] 'cause there's nothing in the law about this.

[318.575 - 320.155] So we'll talk a little bit more about that,

[320.215 - 321.515] but that's definitely something

[321.515 - 323.155] that I think about all the time.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[324.275 - 325.455] Thanks so much, Catherine.

[325.455 - 326.655] We're so excited that you're here

[326.655 - 328.335] and we're gonna get to hear a little bit

[328.535 - 329.735] about your experience and insight.

[329.875 - 331.775] Um, Amelia, I turn it over to you

[331.775 - 333.055] for a quick introduction as well.

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[333.645 - 336.215] Sure. Thank you. Um, my name's Amelia Hinky.

[336.455 - 339.055] I am the Vice President of Legal at Business Solver.

[339.115 - 341.615] We do health and welfare benefits administration.

[342.235 - 344.215] Uh, prior to my role at Business Solver,

[344.415 - 348.495] I held a dual hat role as the Vice President of Legal

[348.755 - 352.615] and people at, uh, a smaller tech company called File Vine,

[352.615 - 354.815] which is a legal tech organization.

[355.235 - 358.475] Um, when I was approached about being a panelist

[358.655 - 361.715] for today's conversation, uh, similar to Catherine,

[361.835 - 364.395] I was very flattered, also felt a little bit nervous.

[364.755 - 367.955] I don't know that I am truly an expert in this space,

[368.055 - 370.555] but I think we all have to kind of navigate

[370.575 - 374.075] and figure out, um, how to, how

[374.075 - 377.355] to conduct ourselves ethically in these organizations.

[377.655 - 381.475] Um, because I had a dual hat role, um, overseeing the legal

[381.695 - 385.875] and HR operations in a previous, um, in a previous role,

[386.275 - 388.555] I think that can, um, create some challenges.

[388.615 - 389.835] I'm excited to kind of talk through that.

[390.375 - 394.235] Um, as well as just different things I've learned.

[394.265 - 396.715] I've, I've actually always been an in-house attorney.

[396.835 - 398.915] I don't have the practice, um, of,

[399.015 - 400.635] of being in private practice prior

[400.695 - 403.075] to joining an in-house organization.

[403.655 - 407.195] Uh, and so I think that there is, you know, there's a lot

[407.345 - 409.995] that, um, when you're in-house, you're kind of acting at,

[410.055 - 411.795] in a dual attorney

[412.015 - 414.675] and a business advisor role that you have

[414.675 - 415.835] to kind of walk a fine line.

[415.895 - 417.835] So I'm, I'm anxious to dig in and,

[417.835 - 419.555] and participate in today's conversation.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[420.005 - 421.275] Right. Thanks so much, Amelia.

[421.775 - 425.555] And you, you make such a great point, which is n none

[425.555 - 427.475] of us know whether we're experts in

[427.475 - 428.635] this space for a few reasons.

[428.815 - 431.515] One is it's constantly changing and it's complicated.

[432.095 - 436.115] And another, I think is it, this is not the easiest topic to

[436.625 - 439.995] discuss because oftentimes we might be afraid

[439.995 - 440.995] that we're not doing it right

[441.055 - 442.355] or that we got it wrong, right?

[442.455 - 444.635] And people don't love talking about those moments,

[444.635 - 446.515] especially when it comes to things like ethics.

[446.895 - 450.155] But Catherine, to the point you made, as long as we are sort

[450.155 - 453.155] of in the space of I believe that I'm doing the right thing,

[453.155 - 454.275] that goes a really long way.

[454.575 - 456.435] So I'm gonna use this moment as a reminder

[456.615 - 457.635] for the Chatham House rules.

[457.875 - 459.035] 'cause I think they really are

[459.055 - 461.675] so important in this particular space,

[461.685 - 464.195] maybe more than any others, which is, you know,

[464.195 - 465.195] we'll really have rich

[465.215 - 467.155] and deep conversation about some

[467.155 - 469.755] of these ethical quandaries if we are very confident that

[469.755 - 471.155] what we say here stays here.

[471.175 - 472.915] So I'm gonna just really encourage folks to take

[472.915 - 473.995] that commitment seriously.

[474.535 - 475.835] Um, and I'll, I'll level set

[475.835 - 478.515] before I get into some questions, which is to say

[478.515 - 481.595] that we really want, in this panel to explore the challenges

[481.595 - 483.715] and strategies for maintaining integrity

[483.815 - 485.635] and compliance with tech legal teams.

[486.135 - 488.755] We wanna address scenarios where business

[488.755 - 490.995] or clients, frankly just may not be truthful with us,

[491.055 - 493.115] and how we handle things like control person

[493.115 - 494.555] liability in those situations.

[495.135 - 498.555] Um, we wanna talk about how we as GCs foster a culture

[498.615 - 501.155] of professionalism, not just within our legal team,

[501.155 - 503.315] but across the business because we are advisors

[503.315 - 506.115] and executives within our companies, um,

[506.175 - 507.995] and navigating ethical dilemmas

[507.995 - 510.515] that can come alongside emerging technologies.

[511.375 - 514.355] Um, and really what I'm hoping that all of you get out

[514.355 - 516.795] of this panel is, um, a lot of insight from Catherine

[516.795 - 518.995] and Millie, in particular for practical methods

[519.095 - 520.635] to encourage compliance and integrity.

[520.705 - 522.195] What are some real world tips

[522.735 - 524.595] and things that each one of us are doing

[524.655 - 527.475] to help drive compliance, ethics, um,

[527.975 - 529.355] and sort of good practices

[529.415 - 531.395] and leadership in our organizations?

[531.895 - 534.275] So I'm gonna start with, with, with

[534.275 - 536.845] what I think is a really, really hard question.

[537.465 - 540.445] Uh, what happens if your business is not

[540.445 - 541.525] telling you the truth?

[542.065 - 544.165] Um, they're not giving you the whole story.

[544.625 - 546.685] You know, they maintain that they're telling you the truth,

[546.825 - 549.565] but what you know is you know that they're not, um,

[549.755 - 551.845] what do you do in those circumstances?

[552.145 - 554.765] How do you navigate that very hard scenario?

[554.985 - 556.325] Um, Catherine, let's start with you.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[557.505 - 559.925] So this arises in a couple different contexts.

[560.345 - 564.765] Um, one, when you join a new organization, I, I think

[564.765 - 568.205] that this has happened to many people where you can only get

[568.265 - 570.405] so much information through the interview process

[570.745 - 572.645] or publicly available information.

[573.305 - 578.045] And then you get in the role and you're like, oh, oh, no.

[580.305 - 581.405] And I, there's a spectrum.

[581.685 - 584.405] I mean, obviously your organization is not necessarily lying

[584.405 - 585.405] to you or lied to you.

[585.405 - 587.725] Maybe they didn't just, you know, they neglected

[587.725 - 590.245] to share some facet of information.

[590.685 - 593.165] I mean, lying by omission can be a little harsh.

[593.905 - 597.445] Uh, but that has happened to, I think, a lot of us

[597.575 - 600.805] where you realize maybe something unethical happened,

[600.805 - 602.125] maybe something inappropriate.

[602.125 - 604.605] There's a spectrum, maybe something where, okay,

[604.605 - 606.045] now I just need to remediate this.

[606.785 - 608.085] Uh, so that's happened a lot.

[608.385 - 611.165] That's probably the least worst situation.

[611.385 - 612.925] Um, you know, one anecdote

[612.925 - 614.845] that I can share is when I was in private practice,

[614.925 - 616.245] I did white collar defense.

[616.545 - 618.765] So most of the time it was representation

[618.865 - 621.325] of large entities in US government investigations,

[621.395 - 622.605] primarily DOJ,

[622.745 - 626.005] but name the regulator, did it, O-C-C-S-E-C,

[626.185 - 627.925] et cetera, all the acronyms.

[628.545 - 631.845] And sometimes it was individual defense.

[632.275 - 633.525] Most of the time it was entity defense.

[633.525 - 634.725] Sometimes it was individual defense.

[634.755 - 637.925] Sometimes it was defense of c-suite executives

[637.925 - 639.765] that were just getting interviewed as part of the process.

[640.915 - 642.885] Well, there's also a spectrum of truth telling.

[643.115 - 645.645] Like I was definitely in a couple situations

[645.645 - 647.445] where I was not convinced

[647.515 - 649.245] that my client was telling me the truth.

[649.845 - 652.765] Hmm. Sometimes I felt like I had one client in particular

[652.855 - 655.405] where I felt like he was lying to me outright.

[655.715 - 659.845] However, I didn't have evidence of that, uh, one client

[659.845 - 661.165] where I just felt like they weren't telling

[661.185 - 662.205] me the whole story.

[662.735 - 665.845] Again, kind of, is this lying by omission? Yes or no?

[666.475 - 668.725] There's a few things you can do in those scenarios,

[668.745 - 671.405] and this applies to private practice to some degrees,

[671.465 - 673.605] but it's even more important in-house.

[674.165 - 676.885] I mean, in private practice, you can fire your client.

[677.505 - 680.325] And in-house, you can also fire your client.

[680.325 - 682.365] Meaning no one ever wants to discuss this,

[682.625 - 685.725] but I have known individuals that have had

[685.725 - 687.325] to give their business an ultimatum.

[687.635 - 690.365] Like, here's my risk appetite. You choose to do this.

[690.385 - 692.765] You choose to take this course of action, that's fine,

[693.315 - 695.365] will part as friends, good luck, goodbye.

[695.475 - 697.285] Sometimes it's not will part, as friends,

[697.285 - 699.485] sometimes you might have a reporting obligation

[699.625 - 701.605] as a control person, for example.

[702.065 - 704.325] So you can always go to the extreme if it's a,

[704.345 - 706.845] if it's a case where there's some sort of unethical conduct

[706.845 - 710.405] that implicates truly illegal contact conduct,

[710.825 - 713.525] you really need to consider, do I need to go nuclear here?

[713.665 - 717.125] Do I need to consider firing my client, firing myself,

[717.225 - 719.165] you know, firing my in-house client.

[720.065 - 722.805] The other spectrum is you just convey to your client,

[722.905 - 723.965] and this is what I would do,

[724.065 - 726.645] is you're making my job 10,000 times harder.

[726.705 - 729.245] Mm-Hmm. You know, we are aligned with our strategy.

[729.425 - 730.485] We have a goal here.

[730.485 - 733.005] Whether it's you need to gimme the historical context

[733.185 - 735.765] for this product, or you need to make me understand

[735.765 - 737.445] what conversations you've had around this,

[737.505 - 738.525] or who you've told,

[738.665 - 742.005] or have you violated an NDA, fine, we will deal with it,

[742.345 - 744.285] but our interests are aligned here.

[744.465 - 746.765] And you arming me with the full spectrum

[746.785 - 749.485] of information is going to make me a better advocate.

[750.505 - 753.405] And, you know, you arming me with everything that happened.

[753.605 - 756.285] I need to be able to build a comprehensive chronology

[756.945 - 759.565] to ensure that I'm giving you the best possible strategy.

[759.635 - 762.325] Like this is gonna burn us later on if you don't arm me

[762.325 - 763.365] with this information.

[763.785 - 765.645] So oftentimes I think you can really appeal

[765.665 - 770.125] to the pragmatic, business oriented mind of, you know,

[770.125 - 772.805] your CEO, your c-suite by saying like,

[772.805 - 773.925] this is gonna hurt you

[773.985 - 776.885] and your bottom line by not enabling me

[776.885 - 778.965] and empowering me to do my job.

[779.505 - 782.125] Mm-Hmm. So I hope no one ends up in that situation,

[782.125 - 783.125] but let's be honest, I think most

[783.125 - 785.645] of us have been in some iteration of this situation.

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[786.195 - 787.765] Yeah. Amelia, I'd love

[787.765 - 790.205] to hear a a little about your iteration of this situation.

[790.835 - 794.125] Yeah. Um, so I think, I think Catherine, um,

[794.515 - 796.125] said something really interesting, right?

[796.665 - 799.645] Um, about sometimes you do have to go nuclear.

[800.265 - 803.725] Um, uh, but I think that is really, uh,

[804.345 - 807.045] how you choose to go nuclear or,

[807.185 - 808.965] or how you choose to react in general.

[809.785 - 813.485] Um, your, your reaction will tell the business

[813.835 - 815.245] what they can tell you, right?

[815.345 - 817.965] And so I think that from my perspective,

[818.625 - 822.165] the most important thing I do when I start a new role, um,

[822.345 - 825.205] is really to work on building those relationships

[825.425 - 829.645] and building trust within the organization, hopefully

[830.105 - 834.485] to keep, to keep my client from lying by omission,

[834.995 - 837.165] from not telling me the whole story.

[837.425 - 839.805] Things like that. Sometimes that works

[839.985 - 841.005] and sometimes that doesn't.

[841.585 - 845.965] Um, I've had, uh, a lot of luck cultivating

[845.965 - 848.525] that trust in the organization that I'm at now.

[848.905 - 850.805] Um, that was something that was really important

[850.805 - 852.565] to me in a prior role.

[852.925 - 854.805] I led with that. Um,

[855.385 - 859.405] and I noticed that the, the communication

[859.405 - 862.485] and messaging that, that they were portraying outward so

[862.585 - 867.125] to potential clients, to, um, potential employees, uh,

[867.125 - 868.605] that were going through the interview process,

[869.145 - 870.725] didn't necessarily match up

[870.955 - 873.205] what was happening within the organization.

[874.385 - 877.445] Um, and for me, it wasn't, uh,

[877.445 - 880.605] that they were breaking any laws or, um,

[881.465 - 883.925] or even lying.

[884.185 - 887.405] It just seemed as though actions didn't match words.

[888.105 - 891.805] Um, and that's where I had to take a, a long hard look and,

[891.865 - 896.325] and see how clear am I about what matters to me

[896.705 - 899.805] and my ethics, and are my ethics aligned

[899.955 - 901.645] with the ethics of the organization.

[902.465 - 906.725] Um, and so when I think about going nuclear, it was not in

[906.725 - 911.565] that situation, uh, um, a big scary reaction

[911.565 - 914.005] that I had that, you know, you're gonna go to jail,

[914.225 - 915.405] you're breaking these laws.

[915.465 - 916.605] It wasn't anything like that,

[916.825 - 920.005] but it was, I can't continue to align myself

[920.005 - 922.925] with an organization that is not telling me the truth

[923.665 - 926.645] is not, um, doing what they say they're doing.

[927.465 - 929.765] And, and really, like, I, I can't sleep at night

[929.885 - 933.245] 'cause I just don't have a good feeling about the way

[933.245 - 934.485] that they're conducting themselves.

[935.265 - 936.665] Um, you know,

[936.665 - 938.505] but then I think, so I think there's kind

[938.505 - 940.785] of those really big scenarios where it,

[940.845 - 943.345] it really does impact your ability to do your job,

[943.855 - 945.585] your ability to be effective.

[946.165 - 948.745] But then I think, you know, we all work, uh,

[948.935 - 952.545] with sales teams, um, and they're wonderful.

[953.085 - 955.105] Um, but they're, they're clearly motivated

[955.105 - 957.865] to get deals done, to get, to get the commissions paid.

[957.885 - 960.385] And, and I think one of the other things I've experienced,

[960.385 - 962.985] and this is far lighter than, than some

[962.985 - 965.225] of the things we were just talking about,

[965.365 - 967.825] was just even misrepresenting, um,

[967.935 - 970.545] that they have obtained a certain approval that's necessary

[970.685 - 972.545] for the sales process or something like that.

[973.045 - 974.505] And that's where I would point back to

[975.125 - 976.625] the relationship of trust.

[976.925 - 981.025] Um, and, you know, I'll trust you until I, you've proven

[981.045 - 982.225] to me that, that I cannot.

[983.005 - 987.025] Um, and once you do that, then it's just really having

[987.085 - 988.465] to kind of draw the line

[988.965 - 993.705] and be willing to deal with some escalations, um, and, and,

[993.805 - 998.465] and handle it, uh, in a way that I think, um,

[999.085 - 1001.145] you know, you're maintaining your professional tone.

[1001.725 - 1004.025] Um, but, but you know, you can,

[1004.445 - 1007.745] you can clearly explain why something's maybe not moving

[1007.745 - 1009.025] along as quickly as it should

[1009.025 - 1012.225] because there wasn't a, an approval obtained that needed

[1012.225 - 1014.865] to be approved or, or something like that.

[1014.965 - 1019.185] You know, I think this can really run the gamut of not all

[1019.185 - 1022.905] that serious, but making our jobs harder to, to really

[1023.445 - 1025.105] pretty serious repercussions.

[1025.105 - 1027.945] And I think we just need to make sure that we can,

[1028.725 - 1030.665] we can handle that, um, with a,

[1030.665 - 1032.465] with a level head. Um, yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[1032.815 - 1034.665] Yeah. I think a, a couple of gems from

[1034.665 - 1037.265] what you said is it, it can be sometimes challenging

[1037.405 - 1040.825] to just navigate this feeling of, I don't feel comfortable

[1041.055 - 1044.225] with what's happening, but I also feel like I should be the

[1044.225 - 1045.505] one to help make it better.

[1045.965 - 1047.225] And how do you decide

[1047.315 - 1050.425] where on the spectrum you fall on any given day, which is,

[1050.705 - 1052.625] I feel uncomfortable and maybe I should walk away,

[1052.625 - 1053.905] versus I feel uncomfortable and I,

[1054.025 - 1055.385] I can improve this situation,

[1055.485 - 1058.185] or I can steer the ship in a better direction.

[1058.645 - 1060.265] So I think that can sometimes be an

[1060.265 - 1061.585] ethical quandary that we face.

[1061.725 - 1063.625] Um, and it depends probably on the magnitude

[1063.625 - 1065.785] of whatever the issue is that one is dealing with.

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[1066.695 - 1068.745] Yeah. I think you raise a really good point, Jasmine.

[1068.885 - 1071.445] And I think it's funny, I actually, um,

[1071.585 - 1074.805] in a prior organization, uh, had that exact conversation

[1074.835 - 1076.365] with a colleague, right?

[1076.545 - 1078.685] Um, didn't feel comfortable about the

[1078.685 - 1079.805] direction things were going.

[1081.245 - 1083.025] If there's going to be a change made,

[1084.475 - 1087.635] I feel like I have an ethical duty to try to make

[1087.835 - 1092.635] that change, whether it's in, you know, diversity, equity

[1092.655 - 1095.475] and inclusion initiatives or, or things like that.

[1096.135 - 1098.995] Um, and so for me, in that scenario,

[1099.275 - 1100.555] I set myself a timeline.

[1100.655 - 1104.165] Mm-Hmm. Um, I'm going to give this 12 more months

[1104.345 - 1106.605] to see if I can make any kind of impact.

[1106.965 - 1110.045] I had to kind of be really clear about assessing, okay.

[1110.105 - 1114.405] As of today, this is where we're at, indications of success

[1114.405 - 1117.565] that I have made any kind of difference in this organization

[1117.585 - 1119.925] and that we're moving in the right direction would look

[1119.925 - 1121.445] like X, Y, or Z.

[1122.025 - 1124.365] Um, and then I, I have to be honest and,

[1124.825 - 1126.365] and check in

[1126.365 - 1128.965] with myself at the six month mark at the 12 month mark

[1128.985 - 1130.365] to see if there are progressions.

[1130.865 - 1134.645] And then at that point, if they're not at that point, I,

[1135.605 - 1137.165] I like the way Catherine, Catherine

[1137.165 - 1138.325] said it, I fire my client.

[1138.445 - 1139.925] I remove myself from the organization,

[1139.985 - 1144.165] and I, I find something more aligned with, with what is true

[1144.225 - 1146.285] and authentic and ethical to me. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[1147.045 - 1148.925] I, I, the additional recall I'll offer,

[1148.925 - 1151.045] and this will pull from another one of your threads, Amelia,

[1151.045 - 1153.365] about the sales team in particular, is, you know,

[1153.365 - 1157.325] oftentimes sales teams have different, um, charters

[1157.425 - 1159.005] or missions of their own, right?

[1159.005 - 1162.085] Like, by any means possible, which they, they may take

[1162.225 - 1163.725] as like, I can break any rule

[1163.725 - 1165.365] and I can do whatever I want, if that's the charge

[1165.365 - 1166.645] that my leadership is giving me.

[1167.105 - 1170.165] Or sort of like, do anything possible, breakthrough walls,

[1170.345 - 1172.845] but do it in a way that's ethical and compliant.

[1172.985 - 1177.685] And, you know, I, that is, I think the, the tread

[1177.685 - 1180.605] that my team tend tends to take is we wanna do anything

[1180.725 - 1182.005] to break through these walls, and

[1182.065 - 1183.285] we don't wanna break rules.

[1183.465 - 1184.765] We respect rules, especially

[1184.925 - 1187.085] 'cause we at ti do government contracts.

[1187.145 - 1189.325] Mm-Hmm. Um, but what's really fascinating

[1189.325 - 1190.365] for me in the ethical space

[1190.365 - 1192.805] of government contracts is we have a lot of folks

[1192.805 - 1194.925] that come from bigger organizations who will say

[1194.925 - 1196.805] to me things like, Jasmine, you're telling me I'm not

[1196.805 - 1197.925] allowed to do X, Y, and Z,

[1197.925 - 1199.885] but I did it at so and so big company.

[1200.025 - 1202.165] And so I'm not sure why we're being more risk averse than

[1202.165 - 1206.285] them, or, you know, uh, I, I'm pretty sure it's allowed

[1206.285 - 1208.165] because I've done this a thousand times before.

[1208.665 - 1211.285] And navigating that ethical quandary

[1211.285 - 1212.325] and sort of demonstrating

[1212.325 - 1214.565] that this is not necessarily about risk tolerance.

[1215.235 - 1218.685] It's about, you know, what you like commitment

[1218.685 - 1219.845] to upholding the law.

[1220.345 - 1223.765] And sometimes I feel like that gets thrown into the mix

[1223.825 - 1225.605] as like, oh, we're being too risk averse.

[1226.025 - 1229.565] And I like to remind folks like, it is not risk averse

[1229.785 - 1233.245] to uphold your ethical obligation to comply with loss.

[1233.295 - 1236.645] Right. Um, and in, in moments there may be some stretch,

[1236.975 - 1238.405] there may be some interpretation,

[1238.405 - 1239.765] there may be some challenge, especially

[1239.765 - 1240.845] in unregulated areas.

[1240.845 - 1241.885] Right. And Catherine, I know

[1241.885 - 1242.965] we've got a lot to go with there.

[1243.625 - 1247.045] Um, but I, I think it's a unique question to add to the mix

[1247.305 - 1249.285] of like, how do we think about risk

[1249.385 - 1250.805] and ethics in particular?

[1251.025 - 1254.085] And, you know, how do you make sure that you, yourself, can,

[1254.275 - 1256.885] Catherine speaking to your point earlier, sleep at night,

[1256.885 - 1259.285] feeling like you gave the right advice in the context

[1259.425 - 1261.525] of your company, your business, and yourself.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[1262.445 - 1265.965] I like using the response that resonates with parents.

[1266.115 - 1268.725] Like different families have different rules. Sorry.

[1268.925 - 1270.605] I love that. You know, it doesn't matter.

[1270.785 - 1272.685] Uh, you know, we set the standard here.

[1272.995 - 1274.485] It's absolutely necessary.

[1275.385 - 1278.085] And one thing I wanted to chime in on here,

[1278.115 - 1279.885] because I think it's really relevant too,

[1280.005 - 1283.565] a question someone just asked in the chat is, you know,

[1283.565 - 1284.925] someone just noted that they'd like

[1284.925 - 1287.685] to hear perspectives on answering questions without having a

[1287.685 - 1289.885] doubt deep well of expertise to draw from,

[1289.885 - 1292.885] and not always having a, you know, a go-to advisor on some

[1292.885 - 1295.685] of these questions and everything we're talking about now.

[1296.075 - 1297.085] Like, we're presuming

[1297.085 - 1300.045] that the ethical quandary is gonna arise from the business.

[1300.145 - 1302.645] So you know, we're gonna be the ones to step in and fix,

[1303.145 - 1307.085] but there's also, as equally as an important task as GC

[1307.305 - 1309.885] to be comfortable with your own ethical standards

[1309.885 - 1311.845] with respect to dispensing advice.

[1312.105 - 1315.005] Mm-Hmm. And especially for the solo GCs out there.

[1315.325 - 1316.565] I hear you. I see you.

[1316.795 - 1318.325] When I left private practice

[1318.345 - 1320.285] and became a gc, I was a solo gc

[1320.745 - 1322.245] and I had an investigations

[1322.645 - 1323.925] regulatory litigation background.

[1324.385 - 1328.125] So you can imagine, I mean, a lot of the traditional m

[1328.125 - 1330.525] and a corporate work, I was kind of like,

[1331.085 - 1332.405] I have no idea what I'm doing.

[1332.455 - 1336.245] Right. And I think we've had a, a lot of people have had

[1336.245 - 1339.045] that, whether it's industry specific, there's gaps,

[1339.045 - 1342.085] whether it's practice specific, it's hard

[1342.085 - 1345.805] to go into a GC role where you don't have that.

[1345.865 - 1348.205] And, you know, different GCs cover different areas.

[1348.425 - 1350.685] For example, at sibo, I'm able to rely on some

[1350.685 - 1353.765] of the SIBO legal team, which I wasn't able to do at Maple.

[1354.425 - 1356.165] So with those types of issues,

[1357.145 - 1360.565] per maybe it is arguably unethical to give advice

[1360.785 - 1363.205] to your client, to your organization if you really have no

[1363.205 - 1364.325] idea what you're talking about.

[1364.905 - 1367.005] So you have to assess your own standards

[1367.025 - 1370.285] and your own comfort level in terms of what you're willing

[1370.345 - 1371.525] to teach yourself

[1371.625 - 1373.965] or learn versus what you're willing to say,

[1374.145 - 1375.245] no, I need to put my foot down.

[1375.405 - 1377.005] I need to talk to outside counsel.

[1377.165 - 1378.565] I need additional resources.

[1379.505 - 1380.605] My way of dealing with

[1380.605 - 1383.205] that was always understanding the spectrum

[1383.425 - 1384.685] of risk to the company.

[1384.945 - 1387.965] Mm-Hmm. So if this was something like an NDA

[1387.985 - 1389.645] or a garden variety contract

[1389.705 - 1392.525] or a training where, you know, you could go in to L suite

[1392.625 - 1393.805] and pull a sample

[1394.785 - 1396.165] and you could feel comfortable

[1396.165 - 1398.525] that even if you messed it up, the risk

[1398.545 - 1401.845] or the damage to the organization was almost non-existent

[1401.845 - 1403.725] or immaterial, sure, go do it.

[1403.745 - 1405.445] Go educate yourself. Go learn.

[1405.865 - 1407.365] But you know, even if you don't know

[1407.365 - 1409.405] what you're talking about, you do understand

[1409.505 - 1412.805] how much damage, for example, you know, having a,

[1413.005 - 1415.205] a damages provision in a contract,

[1415.555 - 1418.685] like in a significant deal, could, could, you know, exert

[1418.745 - 1420.965] or a lot of the other scenarios

[1420.965 - 1423.765] where it could be quasi existential to your company.

[1424.015 - 1425.925] Those are the ones where you need to assess,

[1426.345 - 1428.285] are you well placed to go out on a limb

[1428.425 - 1429.605] and advise your client?

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[1430.025 - 1433.005] Mm-Hmm. Amelia, how have you dealt with that sort

[1433.005 - 1434.325] of ethical quandary of like,

[1434.925 - 1437.565] n not necessarily knowing all the substantive answers,

[1437.705 - 1439.245] but feeling like you maybe should

[1439.305 - 1440.765] or want to know or want to answer?

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[1441.635 - 1445.205] Yeah, I think, um, as a, you know, generalist, by

[1447.545 - 1450.605] the nature of always having been in-house, um,

[1450.905 - 1453.805] my knowledge is broad, but not super deep in certain areas.

[1454.065 - 1457.525] So, um, so like Catherine said, I have

[1457.525 - 1460.605] to get comfortable in the areas where I feel

[1461.155 - 1462.805] comfortable giving advice,

[1463.465 - 1466.765] and also really understand what it would take for me

[1466.785 - 1470.205] to get the depth of knowledge, um, needed

[1470.345 - 1471.525] to answer the question.

[1472.225 - 1474.565] Um, so if it's something that, you know,

[1475.405 - 1477.325] I could do a little bit of legal research on

[1477.385 - 1481.005] and feel convicted that, hey, this is the right answer,

[1481.105 - 1483.765] and I, I would've spent a couple hours doing

[1483.765 - 1486.125] that work, I will do that all day.

[1486.265 - 1489.685] But I think that there's also, as a, as an advisor

[1489.745 - 1492.525] to the business, right, there's an opportunity cost in me

[1493.125 - 1496.405] spending all of that time researching the topic

[1496.505 - 1497.565] and getting the knowledge.

[1497.585 - 1500.605] And so I kind of, I try to position it in such a way

[1500.605 - 1503.085] of like, Hey, this is not my area of expertise.

[1503.685 - 1505.765] I think it would be best for the organization,

[1506.145 - 1508.765] and we'll actually probably save some money if we can just

[1508.785 - 1511.325] go to an expert in this topic Mm-Hmm.

[1511.425 - 1513.165] Um, get the quick answer,

[1513.385 - 1515.325] and then we can kind of decide from there.

[1516.025 - 1520.405] Um, I, you know, there are certain areas, um, that I,

[1520.685 - 1521.725] I always say I don't touch,

[1521.785 - 1525.205] and that's immigration, um, IP licensing, and,

[1525.225 - 1526.405] and we'll always have m

[1526.405 - 1530.805] and a council handle the big deals, um, for us other, like,

[1530.805 - 1531.885] you know, employment matters.

[1532.305 - 1534.085] If it gets to litigation, of course we will,

[1534.105 - 1536.725] but we can probably navigate most of those in-house.

[1536.825 - 1540.485] And so I just kind of get pretty clear about the areas

[1540.515 - 1543.245] that I'm comfortable advising on, and, and when I'm not,

[1543.345 - 1545.325] or stepping outside of that wheelhouse, I,

[1545.525 - 1548.365] I very quickly would raise that flag to the organization

[1548.505 - 1551.925] and be prepared to, to pull somebody else in. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[1552.345 - 1554.285] And I'll, I'll share my personal experience

[1554.305 - 1556.325] as a solo GC in a company

[1556.325 - 1558.685] that had never had legal counsel before.

[1559.365 - 1562.005] I had to do a lot of work internally to sort

[1562.005 - 1563.845] of explain that.

[1563.845 - 1566.685] Like, no, I didn't know the answer to every possible

[1567.285 - 1568.725] question that could come my way.

[1569.065 - 1571.685] And there was sort of this expectation of like, well, you,

[1571.705 - 1573.325] you're just gonna do this too, right?

[1573.345 - 1574.605] Or like, we're not gonna have to use

[1574.605 - 1575.965] outside counsel at all anymore.

[1575.965 - 1580.325] Right. And it was sort of, you know, my process of sort

[1580.325 - 1581.725] of explaining to folks like, you know,

[1581.825 - 1584.045] you don't ask a heart doctor to do foot surgery.

[1584.185 - 1586.285] You know, I, I've heard so many lawyers use that analogy.

[1586.725 - 1590.205] I had to do that and sort of explain that, uh,

[1590.595 - 1591.605] time and time again.

[1591.745 - 1594.565] And also sort of navigate my own feeling of

[1596.375 - 1599.685] where do I feel ethically bound to do something,

[1599.865 - 1604.645] and where do I feel sort of like bound by my own sense

[1604.645 - 1605.645] of perfectionism?

[1605.985 - 1608.205] And I don't know about anybody else on this call,

[1608.205 - 1609.925] especially first time GCs, right?

[1610.225 - 1613.045] But like, that's a really hard line to unpack

[1613.305 - 1615.005] and sort of come away with from clarity,

[1615.005 - 1617.085] because there were so many times that I was eager,

[1617.545 - 1618.685] and I thought to myself, well,

[1618.685 - 1620.085] if I was perfect, I would know the answer.

[1620.265 - 1622.885] Or if I worked harder, I could figure this out. Right?

[1623.385 - 1625.765] But then sometimes reminding myself, well, like ethically,

[1625.845 - 1628.125] I don't feel comfortable advising on this thing, no matter

[1628.185 - 1630.205] how much I study up or practice

[1630.205 - 1633.325] or ask people in tech gc, for example, for their support,

[1633.895 - 1636.405] there is a limit to what I can offer to this conversation.

[1636.505 - 1639.485] So, for anybody else navigating this really complicated

[1639.885 - 1641.005] situation, no, two things.

[1641.025 - 1642.525] One, you're not alone. Um,

[1642.585 - 1645.205] and two, this community feels like a really good place

[1645.305 - 1647.245] to sort of ask the question of like,

[1647.375 - 1648.525] would you go this alone?

[1648.865 - 1650.565] Or how, you know, how would you deal with this?

[1651.385 - 1652.845] But thank you both for the insight there.

[1653.425 - 1655.845] Um, let's, let's change gears a little bit to,

[1656.125 - 1658.765] I think another topic that a lot of folks are eager

[1658.765 - 1662.645] to hear about, which is, um, regulatory posture,

[1663.205 - 1665.805] regulatory position, and when it runs counter

[1665.905 - 1666.925] to legal strategy.

[1667.105 - 1668.805] So the overarching question here is,

[1669.185 - 1671.725] do you think it's unethical to have a legal strategy

[1671.755 - 1674.485] that runs counter to a regulatory position?

[1674.945 - 1676.365] Um, and how do you ensure that

[1676.365 - 1680.005] what you're doing is ethical when there actually is no law

[1680.025 - 1681.765] or rule with respect to something

[1681.765 - 1683.165] that the business wants to pursue?

[1683.185 - 1684.565] So it's sort of a two part question.

[1684.865 - 1686.485] Um, Amelia, we'll start with you this time,

[1686.485 - 1687.685] and then Catherine Head over to you.

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[1688.385 - 1691.165] Oh, I think this one, uh, is probably better posed

[1691.165 - 1694.205] to Catherine, uh, just given her her role.

[1694.505 - 1695.605] Um, I know my,

[1695.625 - 1699.085] our industries are not super highly regulated, so Yeah.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[1699.305 - 1701.725] I'm jealous of Amelia. I'm very jealous.

[1702.105 - 1704.445] Uh, no, I mean, I think this is a great point

[1704.475 - 1707.685] because as the law with emerging technologies

[1707.785 - 1708.965] and it tech grows

[1708.965 - 1712.845] and changes, like this is obviously a huge issue for crypto,

[1713.185 - 1714.965] for AI or cannabis.

[1715.745 - 1719.085] Uh, but as we see more development oftentimes even,

[1719.505 - 1722.285] you know, more traditional areas are going

[1722.285 - 1724.445] to have this issue where maybe you have a technical

[1724.445 - 1726.845] development and it's not explicitly blessed

[1726.865 - 1729.765] by the regulators, or maybe you're in an unregulated field.

[1730.035 - 1731.085] Like, what,

[1731.305 - 1734.205] how do you navigate an unregulated field for a one?

[1734.205 - 1736.685] You know, how do you know what is and is not okay?

[1737.685 - 1739.245] I think the first thing I always do is

[1739.245 - 1740.525] assess a spectrum of risk.

[1740.945 - 1743.085] You know, like with respect to looking at crypto,

[1743.325 - 1746.085] I always say that there's three big areas of risk.

[1746.465 - 1750.165] One is kind of technical hack, um, integrity, like,

[1750.945 - 1752.365] or your smart contracts good.

[1752.385 - 1755.445] Is your code good? Like obviously there's massive issues.

[1755.445 - 1759.325] There is, are your privacy incident response areas great.

[1759.705 - 1761.165] You know, you don't mess with that

[1761.165 - 1763.925] because like, again, that's, that's pretty existential

[1764.025 - 1765.285] and easy to fill a gap.

[1765.945 - 1768.965] Two criminal also something you don't mess with.

[1769.145 - 1773.685] You know, do you have, uh, A-M-L-K-Y-C sanctions in place?

[1774.185 - 1775.965] If you don't, you better have a darn

[1775.965 - 1777.165] good reason why you don't.

[1777.165 - 1779.165] If you're dealing with flow of funds, like,

[1779.505 - 1782.645] is your position justi justifiable with respect to,

[1782.905 - 1784.205] you know, are you, you know,

[1784.395 - 1787.405] theoretically helping a flow of dirty money?

[1788.065 - 1790.485] And this could be considered a national security risk.

[1790.555 - 1792.085] Like how are you dealing with that?

[1792.185 - 1793.685] You need to have an answer to that,

[1793.945 - 1795.245] and it needs to be a very good one.

[1795.945 - 1799.965] The third one, regulatory, like civil regulators, cryptos,

[1800.395 - 1803.845] it's no, no, uh, no secret that cryptos parts

[1803.845 - 1806.005] of crypto are kind of at war with the SEC.

[1806.555 - 1808.165] Well, how, how is that? Okay.

[1808.265 - 1810.645] How can you be at war with your regulator,

[1810.645 - 1812.045] if not your current regulator,

[1812.045 - 1814.525] if your unregulated potentially your future regulator

[1814.915 - 1818.725] with respect to your posture with the CFTC or the SEC?

[1819.685 - 1823.405] I would always say that at Maple, I spent a lot

[1823.405 - 1827.125] of time on a proactive, regular regulatory strategy

[1827.835 - 1830.365] that enabled me to feel comfortable

[1830.595 - 1833.405] that this was justifiable based on everything that existed.

[1833.405 - 1837.525] Whether that is law precedent, rules, guidance,

[1837.795 - 1841.325] like anything that was out there, I had a response.

[1841.905 - 1845.645] Now, would the SEC agree with my response? Probably not.

[1846.225 - 1849.445] But if put in front of a neutral arbiter like a judge,

[1850.215 - 1853.365] could I advocate for this position with a straight face?

[1854.215 - 1857.125] Could I convince potential strategic partners

[1857.475 - 1859.325] that I had done a degree

[1859.325 - 1861.805] of diligence on the regulatory risk?

[1863.465 - 1864.885] If those answers need to be, yes,

[1864.975 - 1866.965] those answers absolutely need to be yes.

[1867.065 - 1870.485] If they're not, then you're in a problematic space,

[1870.785 - 1873.645] you know, basically from a practical viewpoint,

[1873.785 - 1876.085] but also potentially from an ethical viewpoint.

[1876.525 - 1878.365] Hmm. So there's a lot of gray area.

[1878.675 - 1881.525] Part of being a GC is just having a strategy as to how

[1881.525 - 1884.325] to proactively navigate that gray area, ideally

[1884.385 - 1887.045] before you have to deal with an inquiry

[1887.065 - 1888.325] or with an issue. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[1888.865 - 1890.965] Can, let's talk a little bit how you navigated

[1890.965 - 1893.725] that gray area in terms of leaning on outside counsel.

[1894.065 - 1897.285] Um, what, what would you do in terms of asking them

[1897.345 - 1898.685] for their input and advice

[1898.825 - 1900.485] and, you know, guidance along the way?

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[1901.185 - 1903.325] That's really tough, particularly with crypto,

[1903.585 - 1905.845] and again, areas of emerging technologies

[1905.845 - 1906.885] that are rife with risk.

[1907.685 - 1910.845] A lot of outside counsel these days will not give you a

[1910.845 - 1911.965] definitive answer, you know?

[1912.065 - 1913.445] No, no. Uh,

[1913.665 - 1916.085] law firm worth their salt will give people an opinion

[1916.085 - 1917.765] that a token is not a security.

[1917.825 - 1919.565] Mm-Hmm. Like, that's something a lot of to, uh,

[1919.565 - 1920.605] crypto lawyers joke about.

[1920.605 - 1922.085] Like, it's ridiculous. You might be able

[1922.085 - 1924.125] to find like a law firm in Gibraltar,

[1924.185 - 1927.525] but you know, no credible law firm is going to enable you

[1927.665 - 1929.805] to, to give you a full CYA.

[1930.475 - 1934.485] However, uh, this, this is often something I deploy

[1934.485 - 1935.485] with novel products.

[1936.585 - 1939.325] We are taking the position that this novel product feeds,

[1939.325 - 1942.005] fits this regulatory mold and is permissible

[1942.005 - 1943.045] because of X, Y, Z.

[1943.075 - 1944.485] It's a reasonable interpretation.

[1944.865 - 1947.165] We will seek outside counsel advice

[1947.185 - 1949.805] to confirm our understanding and interpretation.

[1950.025 - 1953.165] Mm-Hmm. Now that outside counsel memo might have caveats,

[1953.345 - 1955.845] but if it's overwhelmingly in support of our position,

[1956.315 - 1959.045] then not only do we look more credible, it's like,

[1959.045 - 1960.125] like an advocacy piece.

[1960.665 - 1963.205] It also underscores the fact that we are trying

[1963.265 - 1965.725] to be an ethical, you know, entity.

[1965.855 - 1967.805] We're trying to be a good actor in the space.

[1968.215 - 1971.885] We're taking our responsibilities in terms of, you know, uh,

[1972.245 - 1974.205] creating novel products that are good for the marketplace

[1974.265 - 1977.125] or, or, you know, needed in de in demand

[1977.125 - 1978.685] by the market participants.

[1979.345 - 1982.925] All of that is kind of check marks in the good actor column.

[1983.065 - 1985.565] Mm-Hmm. So, I like it from a, I can sleep at night,

[1985.585 - 1989.085] but also from our, kind of our external facing brand, uh,

[1989.095 - 1990.565] which is a big issue in crypto.

[1990.865 - 1993.045] You know, we, we are the good actors.

[1993.105 - 1995.205] We are doing good work for the space.

[1995.385 - 1999.005] We are filling a need, which also helps with the policy

[1999.565 - 2001.645] arguments that if you are in an emerging space

[2002.225 - 2004.245] or you know, a high tech growth area,

[2004.385 - 2006.405] you're probably also communicating

[2006.405 - 2008.045] with policy makers. Yeah.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[2008.235 - 2010.685] Yeah. Okay. I'd love to hear sort of also the,

[2010.745 - 2012.165] the inner layer of

[2012.225 - 2014.725] how this manifests itself within your organization.

[2014.875 - 2017.565] Like, if there is ever a hum of,

[2017.995 - 2019.165] wait, how are we doing this?

[2019.185 - 2021.645] And is this legal and what's, you know, how,

[2021.705 - 2023.805] how are we justifying the ethics of this?

[2024.225 - 2027.285] How do you navigate how much you share internally

[2027.705 - 2029.925] to make sure that folks feel comfortable with, you know,

[2030.125 - 2031.605] whatever approach the business is taking?

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[2032.825 - 2035.035] I've always been radically transparent

[2035.035 - 2036.835] with the crypto regulatory environment.

[2037.115 - 2041.755] I have a lot of discussion with the board, my boards, um,

[2042.135 - 2045.275] to make sure that they feel comfortable that, you know,

[2045.415 - 2047.155] our strategy is well in hand.

[2047.505 - 2050.795] This was a big issue with a lot of the exchange lawsuits.

[2050.815 - 2052.755] You know, we were a spot exchange

[2053.095 - 2056.155] and all the spot exchanges were getting

[2056.225 - 2057.315] sued by the regulators.

[2057.415 - 2059.555] So my boards were like, what's going on here?

[2059.625 - 2062.675] Like, how are we doing? How are we, uh, dealing with this?

[2063.375 - 2065.395] So I think you have to be radically transparent, both

[2065.395 - 2067.915] with your governance, but also with your business.

[2068.055 - 2069.475] You know, on town halls,

[2069.555 - 2072.395] I would often give a crypto regulatory overview.

[2072.535 - 2074.235] Here's what we're monitoring, here's

[2074.235 - 2075.515] what we're doing from the policy

[2075.695 - 2077.355] and from the regulatory sphere.

[2078.075 - 2081.195] I would give weekly emails to SIBO global markets,

[2081.305 - 2083.675] like my parent company, senior management,

[2083.945 - 2086.235] that would give them regulatory and legislative

[2086.235 - 2087.435] and enforcement developments.

[2087.495 - 2090.315] And how that change was changing our strategy,

[2090.375 - 2093.355] or how legal was advising a pivot with respect

[2093.355 - 2096.155] to the business strategy based on the legal and regulatory

[2096.155 - 2097.275] and policy environment.

[2097.455 - 2099.395] Mm-Hmm. So you, the transparency

[2099.575 - 2102.035] and ensuring that you have this under control.

[2102.485 - 2105.115] We're not gonna, like, legal is not gonna bless anything

[2105.135 - 2108.755] by the business that we don't have a response to.

[2108.775 - 2111.115] We don't have a strategy, we don't feel okay with.

[2111.775 - 2115.035] Um, basically making sure that you know, that everyone,

[2115.035 - 2116.915] whether it's senior management or your board

[2116.915 - 2119.595] or your salespeople know that you've got this,

[2119.785 - 2122.475] like you've got this, like you need to have faith in your GC

[2122.495 - 2123.835] to kind of steer the ship.

[2124.615 - 2128.115] Uh, this is particularly true of any industry

[2128.115 - 2129.995] that's undergoing high volatility.

[2130.455 - 2134.435] So, you know, crypto in 2022 financial services in 2009,

[2134.505 - 2137.605] like, we could, we could go on and on and on. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[2137.705 - 2139.205] Mm-Hmm. Interesting.

[2139.505 - 2142.765] Um, I think the additional wrinkle I'll offer here is sort

[2142.765 - 2146.165] of, you know, my unique situation at Vinti is obviously

[2146.165 - 2147.805] government agencies are our customers.

[2148.025 - 2149.605] And because we support the foster

[2149.625 - 2153.325] and adoptive care process, we have a consumer facing

[2153.505 - 2157.325] or foster adoptive care facing portal that collects data

[2157.865 - 2160.325] on under the auspices of these agencies.

[2160.745 - 2163.485] And there are just a ton of unknowns with respect

[2163.545 - 2165.765] to government owned data, right?

[2165.825 - 2169.085] And the consents that they have, um, the consents

[2169.085 - 2170.565] that they give their vendors

[2170.705 - 2173.445] or their subcontractors to perform services on their behalf.

[2173.985 - 2176.765] And so, I think sometimes what tends to happen in,

[2176.785 - 2180.925] in my world is sort of this open question of, well, hey,

[2181.215 - 2184.565] government agency, I presume that you have the permission

[2184.625 - 2187.245] to do what you're doing, but actually I'm gonna stop

[2187.445 - 2188.485] assuming that, uh, you know,

[2188.565 - 2189.845] 'cause there are, there are moments

[2189.855 - 2192.285] where there is an open question of like,

[2192.285 - 2194.005] do you have the right to give me the data

[2194.145 - 2195.685] of these people that you're sharing?

[2196.265 - 2198.245] And you know, I know you've never been asked that question

[2198.245 - 2199.685] before, and I'm sorry to offend you,

[2199.685 - 2202.685] but like, this is actually part of my ethical obligation

[2202.685 - 2204.725] to make sure that like we in turn have the right

[2204.725 - 2206.885] to process this data in the ways that you're telling us to.

[2207.385 - 2209.965] So there's, there's an, this is less regulatory,

[2210.185 - 2212.005] but more really exposing that, like,

[2212.005 - 2214.405] sometimes there just aren't rules that cover what we do.

[2214.405 - 2215.885] Sometimes it's just unclear.

[2216.705 - 2220.405] And, um, you know, that vagueness can be a moment

[2220.535 - 2223.165] where you have to decide what the North Star is.

[2223.265 - 2224.405] And at Binti, for example,

[2224.545 - 2226.725] our North Star is putting children first, right?

[2226.725 - 2228.565] Because we support fostered adoptive care.

[2228.905 - 2232.845] And so all of our data decisions really index on our,

[2233.025 - 2234.525] is this in service of children?

[2234.755 - 2237.325] Because there isn't a rule that says X, Y,

[2237.325 - 2239.085] or Z with respect to what we can do,

[2239.585 - 2241.525] but is it protecting their data in the way

[2241.525 - 2243.765] that we know we want to, or that we care about?

[2243.765 - 2246.045] And that's the internal question to sort of your point

[2246.045 - 2248.965] with internal level setting something that I do as well,

[2249.055 - 2251.405] which is, you know, whenever we get internal questions about

[2251.405 - 2252.845] like, well, can't we just duplicate the data

[2252.845 - 2253.845] and put it in, blah, blah, blah?

[2253.845 - 2256.725] And I'm like, well, if we did, the potential risk

[2256.745 - 2258.765] to these children's data is blah.

[2258.815 - 2260.805] Right? And talking about it in that way,

[2261.365 - 2264.565] I think has gone a really, you know, it's gotten sort

[2264.565 - 2266.325] of buy-in, in a way that just saying like,

[2266.745 - 2267.885] no, or that's illegal.

[2268.065 - 2270.085] Or, you know, like, this is what, you know,

[2270.085 - 2271.405] the regulatory regime, or this is

[2271.405 - 2272.485] what the privacy regime says.

[2272.485 - 2275.725] PE-people are less willing, I think, to buy in sometimes

[2275.825 - 2278.805] to those points, um, when presented that way.

[2278.805 - 2281.685] And so the, the ethical connection to the rest

[2281.685 - 2284.125] of the business can really be values based, um,

[2284.125 - 2286.565] and North Star based within, you know, what the rest

[2286.565 - 2288.245] of the company is also orienting on.

[2288.705 - 2289.845] Um, and so, Amelia, I

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[2289.845 - 2291.125] Love that so much, Jasmine.

[2291.485 - 2294.925] I just have to say, I think your primary job as GC is

[2294.925 - 2296.205] what is the ethos of the company?

[2296.385 - 2298.725] Mm-Hmm. Like a hundred percent your North Star,

[2299.065 - 2300.725] and how are you advancing that mission

[2300.725 - 2301.845] with your legal strategy?

[2302.465 - 2306.165] And, you know, they say like, assuming ass, uh,

[2306.215 - 2307.725] makes an ass out of you and me.

[2307.795 - 2310.645] Like, it's true. I haven't heard

[2310.645 - 2312.325] that expression since I was basically a child.

[2312.625 - 2314.565] But, uh, really, like, you could,

[2314.665 - 2317.525] you could apply the same principle to, uh,

[2317.555 - 2319.885] your due diligence on strategic counterparties.

[2319.905 - 2321.725] Mm-Hmm. Like, we've all seen a lot

[2321.725 - 2324.565] of very significant examples of maybe your company wants

[2324.565 - 2327.245] to engage, um, or do a joint venture

[2327.385 - 2329.605] or do a joint press release with an entity

[2329.605 - 2331.165] where you're like, wait, what is this entity?

[2331.235 - 2333.285] What are they doing? What are they doing?

[2333.985 - 2336.005] And you know, I've been dismissed in the past

[2336.095 - 2338.205] where it's like, oh, it's three ac.

[2338.545 - 2340.765] All the crypto people will know that they're huge.

[2340.915 - 2343.085] Like they have so much money, it's fine. It's fine.

[2343.105 - 2345.365] And it's like, wait, let's take a closer look here.

[2345.425 - 2349.285] So sometimes I, I, I, you know, you don't wanna be kind of,

[2349.385 - 2353.085] that's not in my job description in the, the due diligence

[2353.085 - 2355.005] of counterparties, but to some degree,

[2355.065 - 2358.205] it is always your job description as GC

[2358.385 - 2361.245] to be asking the difficult questions. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[2361.545 - 2364.565] Mm-Hmm. Yeah. And Amelia, I'd love to turn it over

[2364.565 - 2366.285] to you to, uh, focus on that part

[2366.305 - 2367.845] of this discussion in terms of like,

[2368.425 - 2371.085] how have you thought about guiding to, you know,

[2371.085 - 2372.925] company North Star or ethos

[2372.985 - 2375.085] or really navigating some of those hard discussions?

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[2375.835 - 2379.645] Yeah, Jasmine, I think, um, the way that you, uh,

[2379.945 - 2382.485] pr like kind of teed that topic up is,

[2382.585 - 2386.125] is perfect at business over, um, you know, we kind of have

[2387.465 - 2391.275] certain pillars of, um, conduct that,

[2391.275 - 2392.315] that are important to us.

[2392.895 - 2394.995] Um, one is trust through transparency.

[2395.735 - 2399.355] Um, and so I think when we think about being transparent,

[2400.055 - 2403.275] um, that means I need to be transparent with

[2404.415 - 2407.035] the leadership team as I'm giving legal advice, right?

[2407.035 - 2411.195] I need to be able to paint the picture of, is this,

[2411.535 - 2412.995] you know, is this a real risk?

[2413.215 - 2416.955] Is this a perceived risk? And, and really how bad is it?

[2417.455 - 2422.275] But then that needs to trickle down to the, the, you know,

[2422.275 - 2425.475] boots on the ground, the people doing, um, doing the work.

[2426.175 - 2431.155] But then I also think about my direct reports, um, and,

[2431.335 - 2432.875] and the importance of transparency

[2433.295 - 2437.155] and building that trust, um, in, in reporting relationships.

[2437.975 - 2441.275] Um, you know, I have to be transparent with them.

[2441.775 - 2443.955] If I don't know something, if I can't,

[2444.055 - 2447.915] if I can't answer a question to them, I, I don't ever want

[2447.935 - 2452.635] to pretend or project any kind of, um, false confidence

[2452.635 - 2455.075] that I, that I have this all figured out, right?

[2455.095 - 2458.635] And so I always, um, try to lead with, um, being

[2458.635 - 2460.275] as transparent as possible with them,

[2460.665 - 2462.755] because then I think that opens the door

[2463.295 - 2465.715] for when they get into a situation

[2465.735 - 2467.115] or get backed into a corner

[2467.695 - 2469.995] and they're feeling like they don't know.

[2470.495 - 2472.955] Um, they can come to me and be transparent.

[2472.975 - 2475.955] So there's kind of that, um, you know, it's a,

[2476.305 - 2478.395] it's a culture of transparency and trust.

[2479.015 - 2482.435] Um, but then I think to, to pile on top of that business,

[2482.555 - 2485.955] olver also, uh, leads with empathy.

[2486.015 - 2488.555] And we think about, uh, the importance of empathy

[2488.825 - 2493.525] with our clients in a benefits administration space, space.

[2493.525 - 2498.325] Um, you know, we, our clients are, are large employers,

[2498.465 - 2501.805] but we also serve their employees who are going

[2501.805 - 2502.805] through a difficult time.

[2503.585 - 2506.005] Um, but it, that, that thread

[2506.005 - 2510.125] of empathy runs throughout every, um, possible

[2511.795 - 2515.645] team scenario, et cetera, within our organization.

[2515.985 - 2517.005] Mm-Hmm. Um,

[2517.665 - 2520.725] and so, you know, as I'm leading my team, the other thing

[2520.725 - 2524.365] that I, that I really try to keep in mind is, um,

[2524.745 - 2527.805] how can I be empathetic with, through what they're going

[2527.805 - 2532.405] through and how can I, um, show them that, uh,

[2533.605 - 2536.645] whatever decision that they've made, uh, whether I agree

[2536.645 - 2539.365] with it or not, how can I kind of relate to that

[2539.425 - 2542.605] and to them in an empathetic manner so

[2542.605 - 2545.365] that we can keep those lines of communication open so

[2545.365 - 2548.885] that we can continue to get better, refine the advice

[2548.885 - 2551.885] that we're given, given to the organization, and,

[2551.985 - 2555.005] and then really just be better partners

[2555.025 - 2556.605] and advisors to the organization.

[2556.765 - 2559.845] I think that's, um, that's really, really important.

[2560.465 - 2564.945] Um, as we're figuring out all of these ethical loopholes,

[2564.945 - 2568.305] like, for me, let's be transparent, let's be ethical,

[2568.715 - 2570.145] let's be empathetic with each other.

[2570.525 - 2573.425] Um, we can figure everything else out. I think

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[2574.205 - 2575.205] I love that. You

[2575.205 - 2578.485] know, I, I think it's probably rare to have a panel on

[2579.185 - 2582.325] ethics that is really rooted in also empathy, right?

[2582.395 - 2585.605] It's like the, one of the paths to ethical practice

[2585.605 - 2588.085] of law is actually being an empathetic person

[2588.225 - 2590.445] and understanding where other people come from

[2590.625 - 2591.725] and are coming from, so

[2591.725 - 2596.085] that you can better help navigate potentially to, uh,

[2596.245 - 2597.445] a different end goal.

[2597.585 - 2599.925] If, if what is happening is not the right thing.

[2599.985 - 2601.805] So having empathy for where they are so

[2601.805 - 2603.725] that you can help them get to a better place, potentially.

[2604.155 - 2607.845] Yeah. Um, and that's actually a perfect lead in to, uh,

[2608.105 - 2612.005] the next topic, which is really fostering a culture

[2612.185 - 2613.645] of an, of integrity.

[2614.225 - 2618.045] Um, how do you do that both within your legal team, um,

[2618.185 - 2620.605] as well as with, uh, across the business?

[2620.945 - 2624.885] Uh, how do you think about setting the tone from, you know,

[2625.035 - 2627.205] your actions, conduct and communications?

[2627.425 - 2630.925] How do you think about enforcing it, um, requiring it,

[2630.925 - 2632.245] you know, carrot stick mentality?

[2632.425 - 2633.485] I'd love to hear from both of you

[2633.485 - 2635.045] and, um, Catherine, we can start with you

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[2636.445 - 2638.205] A couple very practical suggestions.

[2638.835 - 2640.325] Once, one,

[2640.825 - 2644.925] I'd give the same scared straight compliance presentation,

[2644.985 - 2648.485] or I should say I did at Maple, where, look, we,

[2648.485 - 2651.045] we've all given presentations of best practices.

[2651.545 - 2653.845] Um, sometimes your compliance team might do that.

[2653.845 - 2656.765] Sometimes it means more when legal is involved.

[2657.465 - 2661.805] But I actually feel this presentation chock full

[2661.955 - 2664.685] with real life ripped from the headlines.

[2665.045 - 2667.205] Examples of individual liability.

[2667.795 - 2671.365] Like, I think you need to speak about this in, in, you know,

[2671.395 - 2674.325] ways that your sales guy can understand.

[2675.025 - 2677.645] And if you're talking about regulatory issues

[2677.865 - 2680.805] or implications in a way that only lawyers will understand,

[2680.835 - 2682.165] it's really not gonna resonate.

[2682.495 - 2685.405] Where if you, you know, give them concrete examples

[2685.425 - 2688.125] of traders who have actually served prison time

[2688.155 - 2691.485] because of something stupid that they put in a chat like

[2691.555 - 2693.245] that is a lot more impactful.

[2693.665 - 2697.565] So, you know, speak to like the scared straight portion of,

[2697.705 - 2700.405] you know, advocating for high ethical standards.

[2700.675 - 2702.565] Make sure you're speaking to them in a language

[2702.565 - 2704.845] that they can understand that that's really gonna resonate

[2704.845 - 2706.725] with all levels of the organization.

[2707.895 - 2710.835] Second tone from the top, and this is twofold.

[2711.055 - 2714.875] One, ensure that your organization's CEO makes this

[2715.035 - 2716.675] a non-negotiable.

[2717.215 - 2720.755] If it isn't, well that's just kind of a problem generally,

[2721.135 - 2723.915] and there's, it's really hard to change that, I'll just say.

[2724.095 - 2727.115] So maybe that's something you think about long term

[2727.495 - 2729.595] as you contemplate a longer term move.

[2730.175 - 2732.995] But two, even if your CEO is a good person,

[2733.025 - 2736.675] make sure he is vocally supporting legal and compliance

[2737.095 - 2741.395] and vocally ensuring like, we have zero tolerance for X, Y,

[2741.475 - 2744.195] Z, um, and make sure he

[2744.215 - 2747.315] or she communicates that loudly and frequently.

[2747.455 - 2751.195] Mm-Hmm. And then secondarily, you and your legal team

[2751.375 - 2754.835] and your compliance team should really be living

[2754.895 - 2758.075] and breathing, breathing best practices of ethical conduct.

[2758.585 - 2760.875] Like, I, I think we've all been there maybe in different

[2760.955 - 2764.835] contexts where it's someone at the holiday party,

[2765.065 - 2767.555] like it's the lawyer in the room who gets too drunk

[2767.555 - 2769.355] and starts making inappropriate comments.

[2770.795 - 2772.655] It, it's bad. It's a bad look.

[2772.885 - 2774.415] It's a terrible look actually,

[2774.415 - 2776.855] because I kind of think of myself as gc.

[2776.885 - 2778.615] Like, it's always difficult to navigate, like,

[2778.615 - 2780.015] I'm not here to be your mom.

[2781.155 - 2785.135] Uh, but I am also, and, and I wanna be your friend,

[2785.155 - 2787.815] and I want you to be able to come to me and confide in me

[2787.815 - 2789.055] and communicate with me

[2789.475 - 2790.895] and know that you're in a safe place,

[2791.355 - 2794.095] but also know that I'm not gonna b**\*\***t you.

[2794.205 - 2795.215] This is not okay.

[2795.435 - 2797.415] And my best interests are gonna lie with the company.

[2797.515 - 2800.895] And I expect, you know, I am a, I'm a culture carrier

[2801.275 - 2803.575] for top ethical standards at my organization.

[2804.035 - 2806.655] And I think that my team should have the same attitude.

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[2808.645 - 2811.725] I love that. Amelia. Yeah, Catherine, I,

[2811.785 - 2812.965] uh, I completely agree.

[2812.965 - 2815.365] And I think your, uh, example about

[2815.975 - 2819.125] being ethical at a holiday party is the perfect one.

[2819.405 - 2823.285] I, a little anecdote from a, a company trip, um,

[2823.715 - 2826.805] that I was on earlier in the spring, um, one

[2826.805 - 2829.405] of our executive leaders, um, came

[2829.405 - 2831.325] to the table we were sitting at, it was

[2831.325 - 2833.445] that we were at dinner, everybody was having fun.

[2833.745 - 2836.645] Um, but, you know, I was sitting with the legal

[2836.705 - 2839.085] and compliance team and we were very quiet.

[2839.425 - 2842.045] Um, and the, the reaction was,

[2842.225 - 2843.885] you guys are the most boring people here.

[2843.905 - 2845.045] And it was like, thank you.

[2845.285 - 2846.885] I, I'll take that as a compliment

[2846.885 - 2849.645] because, um, it'll be really hard for me

[2849.985 - 2851.245] to be taken seriously

[2851.545 - 2855.565] and to be, um, perceived as doing my job.

[2855.635 - 2859.525] Well, if I'm the rowdiest most, most, uh, you know,

[2860.245 - 2862.245] outgoing person in the room, I I'll take

[2862.815 - 2864.925] being the most boring person at a party any day.

[2865.425 - 2868.485] Um, if it's a professional function, right?

[2868.665 - 2870.565] Um, I think that, that, I think that's important.

[2871.545 - 2874.725] Um, and like I, like I talked about

[2874.725 - 2877.285] before, you know, I think that, um,

[2881.335 - 2882.995] we just kind of need to make sure

[2883.105 - 2884.835] that we are approaching our,

[2884.855 - 2886.275] our team members where they're at.

[2886.415 - 2888.795] So that is being transparent with them,

[2888.795 - 2889.835] being empathetic with them.

[2889.895 - 2894.315] But I think the other thing to, um, move to the,

[2894.375 - 2896.235] to the front of the conversation and,

[2896.235 - 2900.595] and to keep it top of mind is in an organization, uh,

[2900.595 - 2902.275] in a tech company that we're working in,

[2902.275 - 2905.315] we're not working in law firms where everyone knows

[2905.585 - 2907.915] that lawyers have these ethical obligations.

[2908.535 - 2913.075] Um, and, uh, in fact, from my experience,

[2913.125 - 2914.995] oftentimes, um,

[2915.775 - 2918.435] my colleagues don't necessarily understand

[2918.685 - 2922.875] until I take the time to explain to them that I have a set

[2922.875 - 2927.435] of ethical standards that I have to maintain, um, and,

[2927.495 - 2930.315] and really disclose to them I am here

[2930.335 - 2931.675] to represent the company.

[2931.935 - 2934.475] The company is my client. I'm here to protect them.

[2935.215 - 2938.675] Um, that to me is, uh,

[2938.815 - 2942.235] really important in setting the stage of, of, um,

[2942.325 - 2944.675] conducting yourselves ethically and,

[2944.735 - 2947.795] and kind of helping the organization understand

[2947.935 - 2951.195] how your role impacts the overall organization.

[2951.675 - 2955.875] I think, um, we've probably all experienced, um,

[2956.475 - 2958.155] somebody coming to us asking, you know,

[2958.155 - 2961.195] about a personal legal matter, whether it's a, you know,

[2961.925 - 2963.675] issue with their HOA, uh,

[2964.075 - 2966.115] speeding ticket, something like that. Divorce.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[2966.825 - 2968.435] Yeah. Yeah. What was that, Catherine?

[2968.655 - 2971.235] Uh, I've, I've gotten a lot of people asking me for divorce,

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[2971.235 - 2972.235] Lawyers divorce.

[2972.255 - 2974.555] Yes. Yeah, exactly.

[2975.095 - 2978.755] Um, and, and it's just kind of having to remind them like,

[2979.555 - 2981.195] I, I represent the company.

[2981.435 - 2983.675] I, I don't, I'm not a private law firm

[2983.675 - 2984.875] within the organization.

[2985.035 - 2986.155] I don't take private clients.

[2986.895 - 2990.635] Um, I think that there is, uh, I, I sometimes have

[2990.635 - 2992.835] to take it even a step further, um,

[2992.935 - 2995.075] and explain to them the, the concept

[2995.175 - 2996.715] of unauthorized practice of law.

[2997.175 - 3000.035] Um, I am an Illinois licensed attorney.

[3000.355 - 3002.235] I sit in Salt Lake City, Utah.

[3002.395 - 3004.195] I hold a house counsel license.

[3004.385 - 3006.515] That gets me out of a lot of things, um,

[3006.515 - 3009.155] because I, I say I'm legally not able

[3009.155 - 3012.355] to represent anyone other than the organization that I work

[3012.355 - 3015.795] for, um, by a function of, of the license that I hold.

[3016.175 - 3020.515] And so just really, um, speaking to them in terms

[3020.515 - 3021.955] that they understand, um,

[3021.975 - 3024.395] and I don't think that we can diminish

[3024.655 - 3028.405] or take for granted the, the fact that our colleagues really

[3029.025 - 3032.525] do not necessarily know what it is like to work

[3032.525 - 3035.125] with a lawyer until we take the

[3035.125 - 3036.645] opportunity to talk to them about that.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[3037.065 - 3039.215] Mm-Hmm. Heather,

[3039.315 - 3041.855] I'm gonna let you do your CE code announcement. Most

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[3041.855 - 3044.335] Important part of the presentation is now,

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[3047.485 - 3048.485] Oh, you were muted.

**[Speaker 1.0]**

[3048.615 - 3049.865] This is such a great discussion.

[3049.865 - 3051.105] I'll only take a second of your time.

[3051.165 - 3053.505] So I just wanna quickly read out the CLE code.

[3053.845 - 3056.025] So please make sure that you write this down so

[3056.025 - 3058.625] that you can enter it into the post-event, CLE at a station.

[3059.245 - 3063.385] So the code for today is ethical. Again, it is ethical.

[3063.485 - 3063.905] That's

[3064.265 - 3069.025] E-T-H-I-C-A-L.

[3069.715 - 3070.185] Thank you.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[3070.715 - 3072.345] Thank you, Jasmine.

[3072.645 - 3074.905] One other point that I wanted to make on the back

[3074.905 - 3077.745] of this discussion, we've talked about real life examples,

[3077.745 - 3080.385] which I do find to be very effective on both individual

[3080.385 - 3082.985] liability, but also particularly competitors.

[3083.645 - 3085.745] The other thing that I would like to add is,

[3085.745 - 3088.945] so when I was at King and Spalding, the leader of our group

[3089.285 - 3091.425] of the white collar group was Chris Ray,

[3091.555 - 3093.385] who's now our FBI director.

[3093.925 - 3097.025] And, you know, politics put aside, Chris is one

[3097.025 - 3099.065] of the most ethical people I've ever met in my life.

[3099.805 - 3102.425] And I will say having him as a beacon

[3103.245 - 3106.865] for every other lawyer in that practice was fantastic.

[3107.095 - 3109.665] Like, he was an inspiration for me.

[3109.725 - 3111.545] It was kind of a, what would Chris do?

[3112.105 - 3114.945] I have a friend who's a gc, um, I,

[3115.065 - 3116.745] I won't name him, although he probably wouldn't be interested.

[3116.885 - 3121.025] He actually jokingly gave out wristbands like, uh,

[3121.485 - 3126.065] ww g uh, d like what would Greg do like to his c-suite?

[3126.865 - 3128.505] 'cause he wanted to be a constant reminder,

[3128.575 - 3129.905] like if they were struggling

[3129.905 - 3132.705] or if they were, they had an issue, they, he wanted to be,

[3132.845 - 3135.145] you know, on their shoulder, in their head at all times.

[3135.445 - 3138.905] So if you are a good example for not just your legal team,

[3138.905 - 3140.945] but for the rest of the team, like they know,

[3140.945 - 3143.825] like they take pride in the fact that they have, uh,

[3143.825 - 3145.105] you know, a strategic partner

[3145.285 - 3146.585] that's going to steer the ship.

[3146.655 - 3149.025] Well, that can be really inspirational.

[3149.645 - 3151.025] And then the other thing to convey

[3151.025 - 3153.425] to them too is I think most people don't understand the

[3153.425 - 3155.345] concept of control person liability.

[3155.725 - 3158.185] We haven't talked about that at all in this presentation.

[3158.245 - 3159.705] And it's actually essential when

[3159.705 - 3160.785] you're talking about ethics.

[3160.925 - 3163.425] Mm-Hmm. So occasionally I have reminded

[3163.565 - 3165.665] or informed people in the business,

[3165.735 - 3167.545] like I'm a control person.

[3167.975 - 3172.105] Like, if we get sued, like I am theoretically on the hook,

[3172.135 - 3176.105] like I could be subject to, you know, regulatory issues,

[3176.215 - 3178.105] potentially even criminal liability

[3178.165 - 3180.225] for my acts on behalf of the organization.

[3180.325 - 3182.265] So this is how seriously I take it.

[3182.305 - 3183.625] I take it seriously 'cause it's my job,

[3183.625 - 3184.825] but I also take it seriously

[3184.825 - 3187.225] because, you know, this is my career on the line.

[3187.285 - 3189.945] Mm-Hmm. So like that's going to make me, you know,

[3189.945 - 3191.305] make the business really understand

[3191.305 - 3193.185] why you're doing what you're doing. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[3193.975 - 3196.345] Yeah. I, I, I think to, to distill

[3196.445 - 3198.825] and pull out some gems from what you're all saying is,

[3199.045 - 3202.265] you know, the, the methods within the organization I think

[3202.265 - 3203.825] can be broken up into a couple different groups.

[3204.005 - 3205.725] One is lead by example, right?

[3205.825 - 3209.005] So be a beacon of transparency, of truth, of honesty,

[3209.005 - 3212.445] of carrying whatever the ethos of the company is.

[3213.115 - 3216.245] Another is sort of make sure people know the why behind the

[3216.245 - 3219.325] what, uh, whether that's explaining the regulatory position

[3219.385 - 3221.805] or your individual investment in compliance

[3222.025 - 3223.245] and ethical practice.

[3223.705 - 3226.045] So making sure that they understand in plain English

[3226.315 - 3229.085] what it is that is informing the company's position

[3229.105 - 3230.685] and your defense of that position.

[3231.265 - 3233.405] And it seems like another Amelia, from what you were saying,

[3233.405 - 3235.565] another pull for you is really, you know, going back to

[3235.565 - 3238.485] that point about empathy is making it so you know,

[3238.485 - 3240.485] you are transparent enough, uh, and,

[3240.485 - 3243.325] and empathetic enough that you can get people to come to you

[3243.465 - 3244.885] and really share what it is

[3244.885 - 3246.165] that maybe they're struggling with.

[3246.745 - 3249.045] Um, and the thing I, I can maybe add

[3249.145 - 3251.925] as like a sub bucket under there is, you know,

[3251.925 - 3253.165] the approachability factor,

[3253.415 - 3255.845] especially in high growth tech companies,

[3256.405 - 3259.045] I think really cannot be overestimated.

[3259.265 - 3262.765] It is so important to be a visible

[3263.545 - 3266.445] person within your organization as a gc

[3266.505 - 3268.285] or for your, the rest of your legal team

[3268.745 - 3269.805] to be highly visible

[3270.185 - 3272.685] and to be present means that people are gonna come

[3272.685 - 3274.165] to you when they are concerned.

[3274.165 - 3277.125] When they have a fear about, like, actually, I don't know if

[3277.125 - 3278.685] what we did over here was totally right.

[3279.105 - 3282.165] And I think the person I wanna talk to is Catherine Orelia

[3282.185 - 3283.205] or Jasmine or whoever.

[3283.625 - 3285.645] Um, and, and one of the things I've really tried

[3285.645 - 3288.045] to do since we're trying to talk about as concrete examples

[3288.045 - 3290.925] as possible is, I am everywhere all at once.

[3290.995 - 3292.165] Like I, Catherine,

[3292.245 - 3293.845] I follow your suit, I present at all hands.

[3294.205 - 3296.405] I, I attend some team meetings.

[3296.645 - 3300.005] I have one-on-one with staff level engineers on a regular

[3300.015 - 3302.085] basis, just so I can be like, Hey, what's the pulse?

[3302.105 - 3303.885] What's going on? Tell me about the business.

[3303.915 - 3305.445] Same thing with my sales team folks.

[3305.865 - 3308.525] And that's, you know, and that's obviously not, uh,

[3308.525 - 3311.325] there's not bandwidth for all of this all the time, but

[3311.605 - 3312.685] whenever you can do it

[3312.785 - 3314.405] and just be as present as possible,

[3314.445 - 3317.245] I think those are the moments where we can really start to

[3317.905 - 3320.085] not just be ambassadors of an ethical message,

[3320.265 - 3322.565] but be receivers of information

[3322.715 - 3325.445] that may be taking the company in a different direction.

[3326.585 - 3328.525] So I love all of that input. Thank you.

[3328.905 - 3331.565] Uh, I can't believe how quickly this hour has gone by.

[3331.905 - 3334.645] Uh, we, we'll conclude with some sort

[3334.845 - 3336.885] of last minute, um, advice.

[3336.985 - 3340.565] And the, the question is your advice to other GCs.

[3341.145 - 3344.045] How have your thoughts in particular changed on any

[3344.045 - 3345.965] of the things that we've talked about from maybe your

[3345.965 - 3348.125] earlier days practicing to where you are now?

[3348.975 - 3350.155] Um, and Amelia, we'll start with you.

**[Speaker 4.0]**

[3352.505 - 3355.075] Sure. Thank you. Um, I think

[3357.595 - 3360.365] just to kind of echo the point you just made, Jasmine, you,

[3360.425 - 3363.045] you can't underestimate the power of relationships.

[3363.745 - 3366.605] Um, and, and I think, um,

[3369.245 - 3371.055] from, from my perspective, the,

[3371.075 - 3374.215] the deeper relationships I build with my teammates, um,

[3374.235 - 3378.415] and with the organization, um, the easier it is

[3378.715 - 3382.775] to do my job and to do it, uh, ethically and,

[3382.835 - 3385.675] and not feel like I am

[3386.805 - 3387.875] doing something wrong

[3388.055 - 3390.635] or being pushed to do something that I shouldn't be doing.

[3391.215 - 3394.195] Um, I, I think that's, that's probably it.

[3394.345 - 3395.955] Take time to invest in those relationships.

**[Speaker 3.0]**

[3397.875 - 3398.995] I feel the same way. I was gonna say,

[3399.015 - 3402.195] my big takeaway is really ensure

[3402.195 - 3403.195] that you can sleep at night.

[3403.735 - 3406.635] You know, we've all felt very uncomfortable with, uh,

[3407.415 - 3408.795] it could be something the business is doing,

[3408.815 - 3410.235] it could be something we've been asked to do.

[3410.665 - 3413.075] There's definitely a line of that discomfort.

[3413.185 - 3414.915] Like, it's okay to be a little uncomfortable,

[3414.915 - 3416.315] especially when you're learning, right?

[3416.775 - 3419.315] But it's not okay to be uncomfortable to the point where,

[3419.455 - 3421.515] you know, like your moral

[3421.695 - 3424.915] and ethical compass is spinning in the wrong direction.

[3425.175 - 3427.995] You know, look, there is definitely a spectrum of that.

[3428.025 - 3430.395] Like, people are gonna have a different, you know, kind

[3430.395 - 3433.755] of moral standard, or we shouldn't even call it morality.

[3433.775 - 3435.195] We should say appetite for risk.

[3435.195 - 3436.795] Sometimes the JC isn't a fit

[3436.795 - 3438.995] because they have an appetite for risk

[3439.155 - 3440.475] that doesn't align with the company.

[3440.975 - 3444.475] But make sure that if your appetite for risk doesn't align

[3444.475 - 3448.355] with the company, then you either find an alternative job

[3448.655 - 3451.515] or you get comfortable with the risk that they're taking.

[3451.815 - 3455.475] So you can kind of ensure that you're advocating on behalf

[3455.475 - 3456.875] of a client that you believe in.

[3457.175 - 3460.835] You're not exposing yourself to control person liability,

[3461.415 - 3464.595] and that your longer term future isn't compromised.

[3464.705 - 3467.195] Like, those are all things that are very selfish, selfish

[3467.375 - 3468.595] as part of this calculus,

[3469.055 - 3471.395] but they're also really important from the kind

[3471.395 - 3473.955] of top down ethos of the organization. Mm-Hmm.

**[Speaker 2.0]**

[3474.475 - 3476.035] I love those nuggets. Thank you.

[3476.415 - 3479.195] Um, and I'll, I'll close this out with mine, which is,

[3479.195 - 3481.075] you know, to reiterate that I,

[3481.275 - 3482.715] I don't pretend to know everything.

[3482.815 - 3484.955] I'm a first time GC who's been doing this for two years.

[3485.295 - 3489.355] Um, and I'll share that when I first started, I had assumed,

[3489.775 - 3491.395] and we talked a little bit about assumptions earlier,

[3491.495 - 3494.995] but I assumed that a lot of the questions I had were things

[3494.995 - 3497.275] that other people already knew the answers to

[3497.275 - 3499.115] because they had been in the job longer.

[3499.265 - 3502.715] They had done it before, this wasn't their first GC gig.

[3503.135 - 3505.435] Um, and that I would just need to figure it out.

[3505.735 - 3508.355] But what I've realized is as two years have now gone by,

[3508.705 - 3510.395] I've realized that none of us, no matter

[3510.395 - 3511.395] how many roles we've had

[3511.395 - 3514.195] and how many years into either role know everything,

[3514.285 - 3515.915] we're all running into novel issues

[3515.935 - 3517.395] and questions all the time.

[3517.575 - 3519.555] And none of us know the answer to everything.

[3519.695 - 3523.355] And for me, realizing that really alleviated the pressure

[3523.925 - 3527.235] associated with this really tough division between

[3527.235 - 3528.915] what I thought my ethical obligation was

[3529.335 - 3531.435] and what I thought, you know, the seriousness

[3531.465 - 3533.915] with which I take my professional obligation

[3533.975 - 3535.995] and like doing my job at the best

[3536.495 - 3538.275] and highest capability that I can.

[3538.895 - 3541.355] Um, and so I came to know more deeply

[3541.505 - 3543.315] that while sometimes maybe precedent

[3543.315 - 3546.075] or other people's experience can be informative in helping

[3546.075 - 3549.875] address those issues, what's really steering my sort

[3549.875 - 3553.915] of ethical practice right now is commitment to my own sense

[3553.935 - 3556.915] of ethics coupled with an understanding of

[3556.915 - 3559.275] what the company's ethics and ethos are.

[3559.335 - 3563.375] And so you really have to deeply know who your company is,

[3563.675 - 3565.215] who it's made of, and what they believe

[3565.215 - 3566.935] and what their North Star orientation is.

[3566.935 - 3568.095] And also who you are, right?

[3568.095 - 3569.775] Like what, what are you comfortable with

[3569.775 - 3573.055] and what can you to, to Catherine's earlier point,

[3573.055 - 3575.495] what can you sleep at night with feeling very comfortable

[3575.495 - 3576.575] that you've done the right thing and

[3576.575 - 3578.295] that you can defend whatever positions you've taken.

[3579.675 - 3581.895] Um, so I'm sorry to take us a minute over.

[3582.085 - 3583.895] That felt like a worthwhile wrap up.

[3584.075 - 3585.815] Uh, thank you all so much for attending.

[3585.815 - 3587.455] Heather, I'll turn it over to you to close us out.
